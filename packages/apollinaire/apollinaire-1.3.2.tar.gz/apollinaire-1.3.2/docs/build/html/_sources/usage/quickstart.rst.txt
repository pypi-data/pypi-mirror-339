Quickstart
**********

Let's assume that you want to use *apollinaire* to fit p-mode parameters for
a given star. 
First, import the package::
 
   import apollinaire as apn

The name of the stars we are going to work with is KIC6603624, also known as Saxo. 
The package include a version of the lightcurves calibrated following the KEPSEISMIC method (see Garc√≠a et al. 2014)::

   from astropy.io import fits
   from os import path
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   modDir = path.abspath ('..')
   filename = path.join (modDir, 'timeseries/kplr006603624_52_COR_filt_inp.fits')
   hdu = fits.open (filename) [0]
   data = np.array (hdu.data)
   t = data[:,0]
   v = data[:,1]
   
   fig, ax = plt.subplots ()
   ax.plot (t, v, color='black')
   
   ax.set_xlabel ('Time (days)')
   ax.set_ylabel ('Luminosity variation (ppm)')
