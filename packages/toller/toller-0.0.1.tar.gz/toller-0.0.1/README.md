## What is Toller?

Toller provides high-level abstractions for managing complex asynchronous workflows in Python, making it easier to orchestrate, rate-limit, retry, and coordinate many asyncio tasks without writing deep boilerplate code.

Just as the [Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever/) lures and guides ducks, Toller "lures" unruly asynchronous tasks into well-managed, predictable flows, guiding the overall execution path and making concurrency easier to reason about.
