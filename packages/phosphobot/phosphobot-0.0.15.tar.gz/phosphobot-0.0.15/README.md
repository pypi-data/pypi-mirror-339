## Overview

This repository contains demo code and community projects developed using the phospho Junior Dev Kit. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can explore existing projects or contribute your own creations.

## Getting Started

1. **Get Your Dev Kit**: Purchase your Phospho Junior Dev Kit at [robots.phospho.ai](https://robots.phospho.ai). Unbox it and set it up following the instructions in the box.

2. **Control your Robot**: Donwload the Meta Quest app, connect it to your robot, start teleoperating it.

3. **Record a Dataset**: Record a dataset using the app. Do the same gesture 30-50 times (depending on the task complexity) to create a dataset.

4. **Install the Package**:

```bash
pip install --upgrade phosphobot
```

5. **Train a Model**: Use [Le Robot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) to train a policy on the dataset you just recorded.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
pip install -e .
```

Add the `configs/policy/act_so100_phosphobot.yaml`file from this repository to the `lerobot/configs/policy` directory in the `lerobot` repository.

Launch the training script with the following command from the `lerobot` repository (change the device to `cuda` if you have an NVIDIA GPU, `mps` if you use a MacBook Pro Sillicon, and `cpu` otherwise):

```bash
sudo python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
  --dataset.repo_id=<HF_USERNAME>/<DATASET_NAME> \
  --policy.type=<act or diffusion or tdmpc or vqbet> \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/phoshobot_test \
  --job_name=phosphobot_test \
  --device=cpu \
  --wandb.enable=true
```

6. **Use a model to control your robot**: Launch a server (see [here](inference/) how to serve a policy).

Launch the phosphobot server:

```bash
phosphobot run
```

Run the folowing script to control your robot using the model:

```python
from phosphobot.camera import AllCameras
from phosphobot.api.client import PhosphoApi
from phosphobot.am import ACT

import time
import numpy as np

# Connect to the phosphobot server
client = PhosphoApi(base_url="http://localhost:80")

# Get a camera frame
allcameras = AllCameras()

# Need to wait for the cameras to initialize
time.sleep(1)

# Instantiate the model
model = ACT()

while True:
    images = [
        allcameras.get_rgb_frame(camera_id=0, resize=(240, 320)),
        allcameras.get_rgb_frame(camera_id=1, resize=(240, 320)),
        allcameras.get_rgb_frame(camera_id=2, resize=(240, 320)),
    ]

    # Get the robot state
    state = client.control.read_joints()

    inputs = {"state": np.array(state.angles_rad), "images": np.array(images)}

    # Go through the model
    actions = model(inputs)

    for action in actions:
        # Send the new joint postion to the robot
        client.control.write_joints(angles=action.tolist())
        # Wait to respect frequency control (30 Hz)
        time.sleep(1 / 30)
```
