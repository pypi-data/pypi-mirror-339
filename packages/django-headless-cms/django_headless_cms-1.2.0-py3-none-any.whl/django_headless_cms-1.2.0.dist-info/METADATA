## Introduction

### Why Choose Django-headless-cms?

Why choose Django-headless-cms over alternatives like [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/), [Django-CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)?

- **Headless CMS with minimal configuration**: Unlike Wagtail and Django-CMS, which are primarily headed CMS solutions.
- **Responsive UI**: Preferred over Strapi for its user interface.
- **Python & Django-based**: Built on a robust framework with numerous extensions.
- **Open Source**: Unlike Contentful and other paid services, it allows you to self-host your CMS.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with many existing Python and Django libraries.
- **Centralized multi-language support**: Reduces redundancy and allows different content across multiple languages.

### Features

- **Schema Migrations**: Manage content schema as database migrations, making it easier to sync from development to
production environments.
- **Versioning Content**: Revert to any previously saved version.
- **Publish/Draft Content**: Manage published and draft content.
- **Markdown Editor Support**: Enhanced content editing experience, useful for Posts/Articles.
- **Multi-language Support**: Even for Markdown fields.
- **Auto Translate/Force Re-translate**: Use ChatGPT or build your own translation interface.
- **Recursive Actions**: Apply actions like Publish, Translate, and Force Re-translate to referenced objects.
- **Optimized Queries**: Auto prefetch and select related queries for optimization.
- **Filter Published Objects**: Easily filter to show only published content.
- **Auto Admin**: Simplify admin page setup with features like:
  - Sortable inline Many-to-Many (M2M) relationships.
  - Sortable generic inlines.
  - Display publish status of child objects.
- **Auto Serializer**: Simplify serializer creation, including nested relations. Override specific serializers as needed.
- **Rapid API Development**: Build APIs (Views/Viewsets) quickly and easily with auto serializers and optimized queries.
- **Easy Data Import/Export**: Use the admin interface or management commands.
- **Auto-generated API Documentation & Playground**: Automatically generate API documentation and an interactive playground.

The foundational frameworks.

### [Extra] My Story

After experimenting with various CMS frameworks, I couldn't find a suitable one for my needs:

- **Strapi**: Node.js-based and synchronizing schema between development and production can be challenging.
Additionally, it lacks a responsive UI, making minor updates on mobile devices difficult.
- **Wagtail and Django-CMS**: These are headed CMS solutions, great if you need a WYSIWYG CMS. However, they felt
overly complex for my use case and have a steep learning curve.
- **Contentful & other paid services**: While these services are excellent, their costs can be prohibitive. Why pay
for additional slots when you can add them for free in Django?

After further research into Django-based (and Node.js-based) frameworks, I found none that met my expectations. Given
Django's popularity and extensive ecosystem of extensions, I decided to build Django-headless-cms. I also noticed that
some Reddit users faced similar issues, which motivated me to create this package.

If you appreciate this package, please give it a star. If you'd like to see more features, consider contributing. If
you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to open a GitHub issue (and help fix it if you're willing to contribute).
