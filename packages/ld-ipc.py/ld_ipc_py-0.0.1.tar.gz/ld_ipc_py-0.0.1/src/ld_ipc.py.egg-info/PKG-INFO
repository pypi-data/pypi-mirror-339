from PIL import Image
from ldipc import LDPlayer

# Set the path and index of LDPlayer
ldplayer_path = Path(r"C:\leidian\LDPlayer9")  # Replace with your LDPlayer path
player_index = 0  # Replace with the index of players you want to capture

try:
    # Create an LDPlayer instance
    ld_player = LDPlayer(ldplayer_path, player_index)

    # capture screenshots
    screenshot_array = ld_player.capture()

    # Convert numpy array to PIL image and save
    screenshot_image = Image.fromarray(screenshot_array)
    screenshot_image.save("screenshot.png")

    print("Screenshot has been saved as screenshot.png")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error capturing screenshot: {e}")
