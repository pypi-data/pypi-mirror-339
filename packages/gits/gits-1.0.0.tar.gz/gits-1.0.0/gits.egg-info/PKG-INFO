Summary: Gits is a Python command-line application designed to help you manage multiple GitHub and GitLab repositories on your development machine. Using it, you can easily generate a new SSH key and add a new account to the list with just one command. After that, you can start cloning from and pushing to multiple GitHub and GitLab accounts without any additional OS or HTTP-level configurations. It automatically sets up everything needed to prevent conflicts between your repositories and accounts.
