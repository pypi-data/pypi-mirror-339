# üå± Greening

`greening` is an opinionated, full-stack project automation tool for solo developers and creative coders.

With just a few commands, you can scaffold a production-ready Python package ‚Äî complete with docs, tests, GitHub Actions workflows, PyPI packaging, and an auto-deployed GitHub Pages site.
No boilerplate. No setup hell. Just instant polish.

## ü§î Why `greening`?

Most devs never ship their tools ‚Äî not because the code isn‚Äôt good, but because the surrounding friction is too high:

- How do I structure the project?
- How do I set up CI/CD, tests, and linting?
- How do I make it look legit?
- How do I talk about it?

`greening` answers all of that in **one opinionated workflow**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does

`greening` automates your project creation pipeline:

‚úÖ `greening init` ‚Äì generates a starter `greening.yaml` config file
‚úÖ `greening new` ‚Äì scaffolds your entire Python project in-place
‚úÖ `greening deploy` ‚Äì builds and pushes a polished GitHub Pages site

Additional features:

- Automatically initializes a Git repo
- Optionally creates a GitHub repository via API
- Optionally pushes to GitHub (main branch)
- Injects metadata throughout the project using Cookiecutter
- Uses Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes for clean, brandable documentation

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install `greening`

```bash
pip install greening
```

### 2. Run `greening init`

This creates a starter config file in your current directory:

```
greening init
```

It generates `greening.yaml`:

```yaml
project_name: Test project
project_slug: test_project
github_username: chris-greening
author_name: Chris Greening
email: chris@christophergreening.com

# git_remote: git@github.com:chris-greening/test-repo.git
push: false
create_github_repo: true
```

### 3. Scaffold the project

Run this in the same directory as your config:

```
greening new
```

`greening` will generate your project in-place and optionally push it to GitHub.

### 4. Deploy the GitHub Pages site

```
greening deploy
```

This builds a static site using your config and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## üîê GitHub Authentication

To enable GitHub repo creation and pushing:

1. [Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Add it to your shell config:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then run:

```
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

## ‚ú® Philosophy

`greening` is about **removing friction** and **surfacing the soul of your work** ‚Äî fast.
It empowers you to publish and polish your creative tools like they were real products, because they are.
