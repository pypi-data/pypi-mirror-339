# `rbwr`

Rather be writing Rust

---

A small Python library providing sum types that play well with existing
typechecking PEPs and should work out-of-the-box with any good typechecker,
such as Pyright.

For the documentation, look [here][docs]. To see how this scheme for encoding
sum types was conceived, check out [this blog post][blog_post].
