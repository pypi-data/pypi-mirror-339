              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# ktx - Shared context library

[![Build](https://github.com/ktsstudio/ktx/actions/workflows/actions.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ktsstudio/ktx/actions)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ktx.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ktx)

ktx is a Context library aimed to simplify a process of creating and managing shared data in Python.

## Quick start

Context example:

```python
from ktx import ctx_bind
from ktx.ctx import ContextFactory

ctx_factory = ContextFactory()

with ctx_bind(ctx_factory.create()) as ctx:
    ctx.set("some_attribute", "value1")
```

ContextUser example:

```python
from ktx import ctx_user_bind
from ktx.user import ContextUserFactory

user_factory = ContextUserFactory()

with ctx_user_bind(user_factory.create()) as user:
    user.set_id(42)
    user.set_email("foo@example.com")
    user.set_username("foo")
    user.set_ip_address("127.0.0.1")

    # then you can get all this data through getter methods:
    print(user.get_id())
    print(user.get_email())
    print(user.get_username())
    print(user.get_ip_address())
```

## Sentry integration

There's a Sentry integration in the `ktx` library that allows all key-value pairs be propagated to Sentry events:
```python
from ktx.ctx import ContextFactory
from ktx.adapters.sentry import SentryDataAdapter

factory = ContextFactory(adapters=[SentryDataAdapter()])
ctx = factory.create()

ctx.set("attr1", "val1")
ctx.set("_attr2", "val2")  # private fields don't get sent to Sentry

# attr1 will be in Sentry event's extras, and _attr2 will not be
```

The similar situation is with `ContextUser`:

```python
from ktx.user import ContextUserFactory
from ktx.adapters.sentry import SentryUserAdapter

factory = ContextUserFactory(adapters=[SentryUserAdapter()])
user = factory.create()

user.set_id(42)
user.set_email("foo@example.com")
user.set_username("foo")
user.set_ip_address("127.0.0.1")

# Sentry will receive user object with all proper fields set
```

## Introduction

### Context

You may set created Context object as *current* for current thread or asyncio.Task:

```python
from ktx import ctx_bind, get_current_ctx
from ktx.ctx import ContextFactory

ctx_factory = ContextFactory()

with ctx_bind(ctx_factory.create()) as ctx:
    ctx.set("some_attribute", "value1")

    assert get_current_ctx() is ctx
```

But also (thanks for `ContextVar`) context is available in any place of current coroutine in asyncio-world (note that asyncio-context is copied in the creating of new tasks):

````python
import asyncio

from ktx import get_current_ctx, ctx_bind
from ktx.ctx import ContextFactory


async def f1():
    ctx = get_current_ctx()
    assert ctx.get("some_attribute") == "value1"


async def main():
    ctx_factory = ContextFactory()

    with ctx_bind(ctx_factory.create()) as ctx:
        ctx.set("some_attribute", "value1")

        task1 = asyncio.create_task(f1())
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

    await task1
````

There exists an abstract interface (Protocol) for any "kind of Contex", so you may implement your own Context classes by implementing `ktx.abc.Context` protocol:


## API

### Context

Context provides the following methods:

- `set(key: str, value: Any) -> Any`: set value by key
- `get(key: str) -> Any`: get value by key
- `get_data() -> Mapping[str, Any]`: get all shared data
- `ktx_id() -> str`: get unique id of context

## Data Inheritance

This is best described using the following snippet:

```python
from ktx import ctx_bind
from ktx.ctx import ContextFactory

ctx_factory = ContextFactory()

with ctx_bind(ctx_factory.create()) as parent_ctx:
    parent_ctx.set("attr1", "val1")
    parent_ctx.set("attr2", "val2")

    with ctx_bind(ctx_factory.create()) as child_ctx:
        assert child_ctx.get("attr1") == "val1"
        assert child_ctx.get("attr2") == "val2"

        child_ctx.set("attr2", "val3")
        assert child_ctx.get("attr2") == "val3"

    assert parent_ctx.get("attr2") == "val2"
```


## Logging

### Structlog
There is a helper function `ktx.log.ktx_add_log` useful for [structlog](https://structlog.org/) processors that propagates all Context-specific attributes to a logging event dict.

## Custom context

It is possible to define a custom Context class in order to better support strong typing. You would need to implement `ktx.abc.`Context protocol and then you may use it with `ctx_bind` functions as usual.

Note that you would need to implement general `get()` and `set()` methods for arbitrary fields as they may be accessed by other libraries which are using `Context`.

And the `get_data()` method must return all *shared* data of this context so it will be available during logging. For example:

```python
from typing import Mapping, Any

from ktx.abc import AbstractContext


class MyContext(AbstractContext):  # Note that inheritance from the protocol is not required.
    def __init__(self, ktx_id: str, *, custom_field: str):
        self.custom_field = custom_field

        self._ktx_id = ktx_id
        self._data: dict[str, Any] = {}

    def ktx_id(self) -> str:
        return self._ktx_id

    def get_data(self) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
        return {
            **self._data,
            "custom_field": self.custom_field,
        }

    def get(self, key: str) -> Any:
        return self._data.get(key)

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any):
        self._data[key] = value
```

Also you may benefit from extending included `Context` class:
```python
from typing import Mapping, Any

from ktx.ctx import Context

class MyContext(Context):  # Note that inheritance from the protocol is not required.
    def __init__(self, ktx_id: str, *, custom_field: str):
        super().__init__(ktx_id)
        self.custom_field = custom_field
```


And then you may use this `MyContext` in safe manner like this:

```python
from ktx import ctx_bind, get_current_ctx

with ctx_bind(MyContext("id1")) as ctx:
    ctx.custom_field = "value1"

    assert get_current_ctx(MyContext) is ctx
```
