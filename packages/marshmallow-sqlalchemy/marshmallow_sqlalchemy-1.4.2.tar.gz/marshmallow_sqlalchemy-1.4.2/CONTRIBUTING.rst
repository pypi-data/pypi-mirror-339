Setting up for local development

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow-sqlalchemy.git
    $ cd marshmallow-sqlalchemy

2. Install development requirements. **It is highly recommended that you use a virtualenv.**
   Use the following command to install an editable version of
   marshmallow-sqlalchemy along with its development requirements.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # After activating your virtualenv
    $ pip install -e '.[dev]'

3. Install the pre-commit hooks, which will format and lint your git staged files.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # The pre-commit CLI was installed above
    $ pre-commit install

Pull requests
--------------

1. Create a new local branch.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # For a new feature
    $ git checkout -b name-of-feature dev

    # For a bugfix
    $ git checkout -b fix-something 1.2-line

2. Commit your changes. Write `good commit messages <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ git commit -m "Detailed commit message"
    $ git push origin name-of-feature

3. Before submitting a pull request, check the following:

- If the pull request adds functionality, it is tested and the docs are updated.
- You've added yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

4. Submit a pull request to ``marshmallow-code:dev`` or the appropriate maintenance branch.
   The `CI <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow-sqlalchemy/actions/workflows/build-release.yml>`_ build
   must be passing before your pull request is merged.

Running tests
-------------

To run all tests:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ pytest

To run formatting and syntax checks:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ tox -e lint

(Optional) To run tests in all supported Python versions in their own virtual environments (must have each interpreter installed):

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ tox

Documentation
-------------

Contributions to the documentation are welcome. Documentation is written in `reStructuredText`_ (rST). A quick rST reference can be found `here <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_. Builds are powered by Sphinx_.

To build and serve the docs in "watch" mode:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ tox -e docs-serve

Changes to documentation will automatically trigger a rebuild.
