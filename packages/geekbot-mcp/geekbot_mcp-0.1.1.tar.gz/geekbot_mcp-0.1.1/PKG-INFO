## Configuration

Before using Geekbot MCP, you need to set up your Geekbot API key:

You can obtain your Geekbot API key from [here](https://geekbot.com/dashboard/api-webhooks).

Configure the mcp server in your claude_desktop_config.json

```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "",
  "mcpServers": {
    "geekbot-mcp": {
      "command": "<path-to-your-uv-executable>",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "geekbot-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GB_API_KEY": "<your-geekbot-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To find the path to your uv executable, you can run `which uv` in your terminal.
You can find more information about the configuration [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/)
