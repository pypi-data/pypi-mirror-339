# Interactive HTML BOM plugin for KiCad
## Supports EasyEDA, Eagle, Fusion360 and Allegro PCB designer

![icon](https://i.imgur.com/js4kDOn.png)

This plugin generates a convenient Bill of Materials (BOM) listing with the
ability to visually correlate and easily search for components and their placements
on the PCB. It is particularly useful when hand-soldering a prototype, as it allows
users to quickly find locations of components groups on the board. It is also possible
to reverse lookup the component group by clicking on a footprint on the board drawing.

The plugin utilizes Pcbnew python API to read PCB data and render silkscreen, fab layer,
footprint pads, text, and drawings. BOM table fields and grouping is fully configurable,
additional columns, such as a manufacturer ID, can be added in Schematic editor and
imported either through the netlist file, XML file generated by Eeschema's internal
BOM tool, or from board file itself.

There is an option to include tracks/zones data as well as netlist information allowing
dynamic highlight of nets on the board.

For full description of functionality see [wiki](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom/wiki).

Generated html page is fully self contained, doesn't need internet connection to work
and can be packaged with documentation of your project or hosted anywhere on the web.
