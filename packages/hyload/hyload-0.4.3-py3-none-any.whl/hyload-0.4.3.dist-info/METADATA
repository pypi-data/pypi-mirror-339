It provides a high-performance Python library to develop load testing. So you could run your test program on Windowsï¼Œ MacOS and Linux.

Based on gevent, by launching multiple hyload workers, it could reach about tens of thousands of requests per second and hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections on a single machine.

It also provides a VS Code extension to let you observe realtime statistics, remote multi-host deploy and remote launching test. VS Code extension includes a code-helper to facilitate developing.
