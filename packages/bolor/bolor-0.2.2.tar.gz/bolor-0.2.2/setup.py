    Bolor is a local LLM-based code repair tool with self-healing capabilities.
    It can scan codebases for issues, fix detected problems, and generate code from natural language descriptions.
    The tool is designed to work locally without requiring an internet connection.
    
    ## Key Features
    
    - **Code Scanning**: Scan your code for issues and get suggestions for improvements
    - **Code Generation**: Generate code from natural language prompts
    - **Local Operation**: Works offline with local models
    
    ## Update Command
    
    This version adds a new `update` command that resolves model loading issues:
    
    ```
    bolor update
    ```
    
    This command will download the necessary model files and properly configure Bolor to work with them.
