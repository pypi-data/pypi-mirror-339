Supply-Chain Firewall is a command-line tool for preventing the installation of malicious PyPI and npm packages.  It is intended primarily for use by engineers to protect their development workstations from compromise in a supply-chain attack.

![scfw demo usage](https://github.com/DataDog/supply-chain-firewall/blob/main/images/demo.gif?raw=true)

Supply-Chain Firewall collects all targets that would be installed by a given `pip` or `npm` command and checks them against reputable sources of data on open-source malware and vulnerabilities.  The command is automatically blocked when any data source finds that any target is malicious.  In cases where a data source reports other findings for a target, they are presented to the user along with a prompt confirming intent to proceed with the installation.

Default data sources include:

- Datadog Security Research's public [malicious packages dataset](https://github.com/DataDog/malicious-software-packages-dataset)
- [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev) advisories

Users may also implement verifiers for alternative data sources. A template for implementating custom verifiers may be found in `examples/verifier.py`. Details may also be found in the API documentation.

The principal goal of Supply-Chain Firewall is to block 100% of installations of known-malicious packages within the purview of its data sources.

## Getting started

### Installation

The simplest way to install Supply-Chain Firewall is via `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install scfw
```

This will install the `scfw` command-line program into your global Python environment.  If desired, this can also be done inside a `virtualenv`.

To check whether the installation succeeded, run the following command and verify that you see output similar to the following.

```bash
$ scfw --version
1.3.3
```

### Post-installation steps

To get the most out of Supply-Chain Firewall, it is recommended to run the `scfw configure` command after installation.  This script will walk you through configuring your environment so that all `pip` or `npm` commands are passively run through `scfw` as well as enabling Datadog logging, described in more detail below.

```bash
$ scfw configure
...
```

### Compatibility

|  Package manager  |  Compatible versions  |
| :---------------: | :-------------------: |
| npm               | >= 7.0                |
| pip               | >= 22.2               |

In keeping with its goal of blocking 100% of known-malicious package installations, `scfw` will refuse to run with an incompatible version of a supported package manager.  Please upgrade to or verify that you are running a compatible version before using this tool.

Currently, Supply-Chain Firewall is only fully supported on macOS systems, though it should run as intended on common Linux distributions.  It is currently not supported on Windows.

### Uninstalling Supply-Chain Firewall

Supply-Chain Firewall may be uninstalled via `pip uninstall scfw`.  Before doing so, be sure to run the command `scfw configure --remove` to remove any Supply-Chain Firewall-managed configuration you may have previously added to your environment.

```bash
$ scfw configure --remove
...
```

## Usage

To use Supply-Chain Firewall, prepend `scfw run` to the `pip install` or `npm install` command you want to run.

```
$ scfw run npm install react
$ scfw run pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For `pip install` commands, packages will be installed in the same environment (virtual or global) in which the command was run.

### Limitations

Unlike `pip`, a variety of `npm` operations beyond `npm install` can end up installing new packages.  For now, only `npm install` commands are in Supply-Chain Firewall's scope.  We are hoping to extend the tool's purview to other "installish" `npm` commands over time.

## Datadog Log Management integration

Supply-Chain Firewall can optionally send logs of blocked and successful installations to Datadog.

Users can configure their environments so that Supply-Chain Firewall forwards logs either via the Datadog HTTP API (requires an API key) or to a local Datadog Agent process.  Configuration consists of setting necessary environment variables and, for Agent log forwarding, configuring the Datadog Agent to accept logs from Supply-Chain Firewall.

To opt in, use the `scfw configure` command to interactively or non-interactively configure your environment for Datadog logging.

Supply-Chain Firewall can integrate with user-supplied loggers.  A template for implementating a custom logger may be found in `examples/logger.py`. Refer to the API documentation for details.
