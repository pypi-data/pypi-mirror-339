#tool for automated analysis and analysis pipeline

"""
capacity: measures how much data can be stored in a cover
detectability: performs tests how well it can be recognized
efficiency: measures time and memory efficiency
imperceptibility: measures perceivable distortions of cover
robustness: performs attacks
accuracy: measures extraction accuracy

visualizer: visualize differences etc.
