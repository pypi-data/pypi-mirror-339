# Next-generation BPNet models

>[!WARNING]
>This is an experimental playground for BPNet-like models.

BPNet is a family of [base-resolution DNA sequence models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00782-6).

This repository is an experimental playground for different models stemming from the original BPNet architecture.

Model implementations in this repository are heavily based on, and would not be possible without, their original implementations, which are linked below.

## Models

### [BPNet](src/bpnext/models/bpnet.py)

```python
from bpnext.models import BPNet
```

BPNet is a model for predicting base-resolution transcription factor binding profiles from DNA sequences. BPNet models are trained using ChIP-nexus or ChIP-seq data.

- The model is described in detail in the publication [Avsec et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00782-6).

- The model was originally implemented in TensorFlow by [zigaavsec](https://github.com/Avsecz): [bpnet](https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet).

### [ChromBPNet](src/bpnext/models/chrombpnet.py)

```python
from bpnext.models import ChromBPNet
```

ChromBPNet is a model for predicting base-resolution chromatin accessibility profiles from DNA sequences. ChromBPNet models are trained using ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data.

- The model and its applications are described in detail in the preprint [Pampari et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.25.630221.abstract).

- The model was originally implemented in TensorFlow by [panushri25](https://github.com/panushri25): [chrombpnet](https://github.com/kundajelab/chrombpnet). 

- Object-oriented implementation of ChromBPNet has been later written by [jmschrei](https://github.com/jmschrei) in PyTorch: [dragonnfruit](https://github.com/jmschrei/bpnet-lite).

### [DragoNNFruit](src/bpnext/models/dragonnfruit.py)

```python
from bpnext.models import DragoNNFruit
```

DragoNNFruit is a model for predicting base-resolution chromatin accessibility profiles from DNA sequences and cell states. The model has been designed to be trained on single-cell ATAC-seq data and multiome data.

This model is currently under development.

- The model has been originally implemented in PyTorch by [jmschrei](https://github.com/jmschrei): [dragonnfruit](https://github.com/jmschrei/dragonnfruit).
