Cryptomus API library developed by a python addict who did not find any documentations on how to use the API using python and decided to craft one for the better!.

This project is not an official one from Cryptomus. Rather, it was created by Ted Hackwell to make it easier for developers to integrate with the Cryptomus API using python.
