You will be disconnected from steam chat in the official steam app when you
login with sleamdge. This is known issue in the underlying
`steam.py <https://pypi.org/project/steamio/>`_ lib. However, you can just
hit "sign in" in the official steam client and you'll be connected from both
slidge and the official chat app this way.
