    """
    This function uses a "flag" system to control what's allowed and what isn't.
    You can pass these in a set called "flags" in the arguments.
    Certain flags switch the function to dictionary output, to include whatever data you requested.
    The simple boolean output is still included in the dictionary output, in the "numeric" field.
    The flags are in variables, but you can also use their string values.
    1: NM_ALLOW_NEGATIVE - Set to the string "AN" and enabled by default, this flag allows negative numbers.
    2: NM_ALLOW_DECIMALS - Set to the string "AD", this flag allows numbers with decimals.
    3: NM_ALLOW_LEADING_ZERO - Set to the string "AZ", this flag allows "invalid" numbers like 01.
    4: NM_ALLOW_PLUS_SIGN - Set to the string "AP", this flag allows explicitly positive numbers, such as +2.
    5: NM_RETURN_MATCH - Set to the string "RM", this flag uses dictionary output and returns the raw output of the match function inside the "match" field.
    6: NM_RETURN_REGEX - Set to the string "RX", this flag uses dictionary output and returns the constructed regex inside the "regex" field.
