#Goal
A mismatch between a purchase order and an invoice was found. The invoice dispute investigation process should answer the following:
Should the company move forward with the dispute with the supplier?
What should the company do when the purchase order has Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) that do not match the invoice? 
What should be the desired outcomes for the Company?
What is the email address of the contact for the Supplier when we have Invoice disputes? If the email is not found or is in invalid format, please escalate.
