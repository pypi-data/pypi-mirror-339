# MCP Protocol Alignment Discovery - v7

## Instruction on how to create new version for this document:
- Copy all sections before the "Current Architecture Analysis" from the previous version (exception updating the Documentation Date. 
- Review the accuracy of the "Current Architecture Analysis" and all sections after for accuracy, which means to review the whole codebase and design against the MCP Protocol and SDK documents.

## Reference Documentation
This discovery effort is based on the following official Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation sources:
- Primary Source: [MCP Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
- Implementation Reference: [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- Documentation Date: March 30, 2024

## Overview
This document is the output of an architectural discovery process conducted to:
1. Evaluate the overall quality of our current architecture
2. Assess its alignment with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
3. Identify areas for improvement
4. Guide future development decisions

**Important Notes:**
- A detailed code review and architectural analysis MUST be conducted before making new versions of this document
- New versions of this document MUST follow the naming convention "discovery-v{n}.md" (e.g., discovery-v2.md)
- All sections up to and including "Executive Summary" MUST be preserved in any new version of this document
- Reference the complete architecture documentation in [architecture.md](../architecture.md) for detailed system design
- All modifications should be validated against both the MCP specification and our existing architecture

## Executive Summary
Our implementation largely follows MCP's core principles and architecture, with some custom adaptations for LLM integration. While the foundation is solid, there are specific areas where we can improve alignment with MCP standards and enhance functionality.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### 1. Architectural Alignment

Our implementation shows strong alignment with MCP architecture through proper layering and initialization:

```python
class MCPToolProvider:
    async def mcp_connect(self, server_name: str):
        """Connect to a specific MCP server by name."""
        # Validate configuration
        if not isinstance(server_name, str):
            raise TypeError(f"server_name must be a string, got {type(server_name)}")
            
        if server_name not in self.available_servers:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown server: {server_name}. Available servers: {self.list_available_servers()}")
            
        config = self.available_servers[server_name]
        
        # Create server parameters with validated fields
        params = {
            "command": config["command"],
            "args": config["args"]
        }
        
        if "env" in config:
            params["env"] = config["env"]
            
        server_params = StdioServerParameters(**params)
        
        # Standard MCP initialization sequence
        stdio_transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(
            stdio_client(server_params)
        )
        self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(
            ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write)
        )
        await self.session.initialize()
        response = await self.session.list_tools()
```

### 4. Key Architectural Differences

```
MCP Protocol                Our Implementation
-------------               ------------------
Standard initialization ✓   Full initialization sequence
Tool discovery         ✓   Proper tool listing and execution
Session lifecycle      ✓   Clean session management
Error handling         ✓   Comprehensive with AsyncExitStack
Resource protocol      →    Not implemented (optional)
Server prompts        →     Client-side prompts
Built-in sampling     →     Custom sampling per LLM
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Tool Handling

Current Implementation (Fully MCP Compliant):
```python
async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
    """Process a user query using the configured LLM backend."""
    if not self.session:
        raise ValueError("Not connected to MCP server")
    
    async def execute_tool(tool_name: str, tool_args: Dict[str, Any]) -> CallToolResult:
        return await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
    
    # Process with MCP types
    return await self.llm_backend.process_query(
        query=query,
        tools=self.tools,
        execute_tool=execute_tool
    )
```

### 2. Server Implementation

Standard FastMCP Usage with Error Handling:
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("terminal")

@mcp.tool()
async def run_command(command: str) -> str:
    """Run a terminal command inside the workspace."""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, 
                              capture_output=True, text=True)
        return result.stdout or result.stderr
    except subprocess.SubprocessError as e:
        return f"Command execution failed: {str(e)}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Improvements

1. Add Structured Logging:
```python
class MCPToolProvider:
    def __init__(self, llm_backend: LLMBackend):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        
    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        self.logger.info("Processing query", extra={
            "query_length": len(query),
            "tools_available": len(self.tools),
            "session_active": bool(self.session)
        })
```

2. Add Performance Monitoring:
```python
async def execute_tool(self, tool_name: str, args: dict) -> Any:
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    try:
        result = await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, args)
        duration = time.perf_counter() - start_time
        self.logger.info("Tool execution completed", extra={
            "tool": tool_name,
            "duration": duration,
            "success": True
        })
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        duration = time.perf_counter() - start_time
        self.logger.error("Tool execution failed", extra={
            "tool": tool_name,
            "duration": duration,
            "error": str(e)
        }, exc_info=True)
        raise
```

### 2. Priority Improvements

## Conclusion

Our implementation demonstrates strong compliance with the MCP protocol, particularly in core areas like initialization, tool discovery, and session management. The architecture shows mature error handling and resource management through AsyncExitStack and comprehensive validation. The recommended improvements focus on operational aspects like logging and monitoring, as our core MCP integration is already robust. This approach will enhance system observability and reliability while maintaining our strong alignment with MCP standards.
