CODE_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a professional Python developer. 
Your main task is to write a Python code snippet that will satisfy the requirements listed below.
I will take your code and automatically execute it in an isolated environment.
In your code, try to assign values at the global scope instead of using functions or classes, to allow better visibility in execution logs and make debugging easier.

Write python code that satisfies the following prompt:
"{prompt}"

## Global Scope:
In global scope, you have access to the following modules:
{modules}

## Args in Global Scope:
In global scope, you have 'args' object. 
This is json schema of 'args' object:
{args}

## Example:
Here's an example of how your code should look for given prompt and args:
Prompt: "Sum two numbers". Args: {{"a": {{"type": "number"}}, "b": {{"type": "number"}}}}
```python
a = args['a']
b = args['b']
result = a + b
```

## Code Execution:
To return a value, assign it to the variable 'result'.
After code execution, the value of 'result' will be JSON encoded and validated against the following schema:
{result_schema}

You can nest these decorators to break down complex operations into simpler steps.

{previous_code} 
{error}
{code_traceback}
{local_vars}"""

ADVANCED_CAPABILITIES_PROMPT = """## Advanced Capabilities:
If a 'forge' decorator is available in your modules, you can use it to simplify complex operations.
The forge decorator allows you to define functions declaratively without implementing them:

```python
@forge("Calculate the sum of two numbers")
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    \"\"\"Return the sum of a and b\"\"\"
    # This function body won't be executed
    # The decorator will generate and execute the implementation
```"""
