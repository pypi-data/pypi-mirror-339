## Inspiration

There are many videos which are like  "25% of your year is over" but there wasnt any cli for that so I wrote one with a progress bar. 

This project was heavily inspired by [sampler](https://github.com/sqshq/sampler?tab=readme-ov-file#gauge) as I wasn't able to get it working on my windows machine
