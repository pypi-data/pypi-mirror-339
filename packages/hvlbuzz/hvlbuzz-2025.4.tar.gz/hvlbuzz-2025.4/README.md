# HVLBuzz

## Installation

 ü™ü Windows (64 bit) | [![](./docs/img/get_windows.svg)](../-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/dist/buzz.zip?job=exe) 
 üêß Linux            | `pip install hvlbuzz`                                                                 
 üçè Mac              | `pip install hvlbuzz`                                                                 

## Development setup

It is recommended that you use a Python virtual envioronement to run
HVLBuzz. Run the following command to create folder called `kivy_venv`
inside which your environement will live. **The latest version of
Python this code has been tested with was 3.10**

```sh
python -m venv kivy_venv
```

Activate your virtual environement by running

```sh
kivy_venv\Scripts\activate.bat # ü™ü
. kivy_venv/bin/activate # üêß / üçè
```

Then install hvlbuzz into your environement as follows

```sh
pip install .
pip install garden.matplotlib/
```

This will also install an executable python script in your environments `bin` folder.

## Usage

To run the binary obtained in the install part, run

```sh
hvlbuzz
```

Alternatively, the module is can also be started from python:

```sh
python -m hvlbuzz
```

or

```sh
python hvlbuzz
```

## Compiling your own packaged version

The source code can also be compiled by yourself using
[PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) using the provided
[hvlbuzz/buzz.spec](hvlbuzz/buzz.spec) file.

```bash
pyinstaller hvlbuzz/buzz.spec
```

A `buzz.exe` binary will be available in a (newly created if
non-existing) `dist\buzz` folder.

## Credits

Originally, HVLBuzz was developed by Aldo Tobler under the supervision of
Christian M. Franck, S√∂ren Hedtke and support by Miko≈Çaj Rybi≈Ñski at
ETH Zurich's High Voltage Laboratory.

Currently, it is maintained by FKH Z√ºrich.

This tool is completely free to use as is and only requires freely
available [Python](https://www.python.org/) libraries to run. The GUI
is based on the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) framework, while the
mathematical computations and plot generation rely the widely used
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
