# Connor's Remote Events (RE)

Connor's Remote Events (RE) is a simple library that allows the end-user to call python functions from another server. This is highly powerful if you are coding an application that offloads processes to another server.

If you want to offload automation tasks to another device, this is the package to use. It is extremely reliable
and robust for near-effort python automation

## Example main.py

In two terminals:
1. First terminal, run the server with `python main.py server`

2. Second terminal, run the client with `python main.py client`

```py

Main Example Script for RemoteFunctions

This script demonstrates remote function execution over HTTP using the RemoteFunctions class.
It operates in two modes:
    1. Server mode: Registers functions and starts a Flask server to handle remote calls.
    2. Client mode: Connects to the server, retrieves available functions, and invokes them remotely.

All communications are serialized with pickle for reliable data exchange.

Usage:
    To run as a server:
        python main.py server
    To run as a client:
        python main.py client

Note: Ensure the server is running before starting the client.
