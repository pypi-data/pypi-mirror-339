# Installation for Developers

### Docker
1. Install [docker-desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
2. Ensure docker-desktop has at least 4 GB of memory allocated to it.
3. `git clone git@github.com:theNewFlesh/cv-depot.git`
4. `cd cv-depot`
5. `chmod +x bin/cv-depot`
6. `bin/cv-depot docker-start`
   - If building on a M1 Mac run `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` first.

The service should take a few minutes to start up.

Run `bin/cv-depot --help` for more help on the command line tool.

### ZSH Setup
1. `bin/cv-depot` must be run from this repository's top level directory.
2. Therefore, if using zsh, it is recommended that you paste the following line
    in your ~/.zshrc file:
    - `alias cv-depot="cd [parent dir]/cv-depot; bin/cv-depot"`
    - Replace `[parent dir]` with the parent directory of this repository
3. Consider adding the following line to your ~/.zshrc if you are using a M1 Mac:
    - `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`
4. Running the `zsh-complete` command will enable tab completions of the cli
   commands, in the next shell session.

   For example:
   - `cv-depot [tab]` will show you all the cli options, which you can press
     tab to cycle through
   - `cv-depot docker-[tab]` will show you only the cli options that begin with
     "docker-"

# Installation for Production

### Python
`pip install cv-depot`

If you are on Debian-based Linux and you run into C library issues such as with
OpenEXR, the following may help:
```
apt update && \
apt install --fix-missing -y python3.13-dev && \
apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    g++ \
    gcc \
    zlib1g-dev
```

For OpenEXR you will also need this:
```
apt install -y \
    libopenexr-dev \
    openexr
```

For FFMPEG you will also need this:
```
apt install -y ffmpeg
```

Please see the prod.dockerfile for an official example of how to build a docker
image with cv-depot.

### Docker
1. Install [docker-desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
2. `docker pull theNewFlesh/cv-depot:[mode]-[version]`

# Quickstart Guide
This repository contains a suite commands for the whole development process.
This includes everything from testing, to documentation generation and
publishing pip packages.

These commands can be accessed through:

  - The VSCode task runner
  - The VSCode task runner side bar
  - A terminal running on the host OS
  - A terminal within this repositories docker container

Running the `zsh-complete` command will enable tab completions of the CLI.
See the zsh setup section for more information.
