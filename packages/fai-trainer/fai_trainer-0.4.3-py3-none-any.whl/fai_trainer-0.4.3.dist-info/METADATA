FAI-Trainer
-----------
FAI-Trainer, the ultimate one-liner for image classification tasks in PyTorch! This user-friendly Python package simplifies the entire data preparation and model training process, allowing you to focus on what matters most - developing accurate models.

With FAI-Trainer, you can effortlessly convert your images into a format that's perfect for machine learning, resize them to the ideal size, and even eliminate duplicate images from your dataset. And if you're worried about splitting your data into training and validation sets? Don't be! FAI-Trainer takes care of that too.

Also: with just a a single line of code, you can train a powerful ResNet50 model using PyTorch and torchvision. No more tedious setup or manual configuration required. Just load your dataset, specify some basic parameters, and let FAI-Trainer do the rest.

Whether you're a seasoned AI expert needing a quick trained model turnaround or just starting out with deep learning, FAI-Trainer is designed to make image classification tasks easier than ever before.

Features
--------

*   **Data Preparation**: Convert image formats, resize images, remove duplicates, and ensure no corrupted images.
*   **Dataset Splitting**: Automatically split datasets into training and validation sets with a specified ratio.
*   **Model Training**: Train a ResNet50 model on the prepared dataset with configurable batch size, number of epochs, and image dimensions.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress tracking for both training and validation phases.
*   **Model Testing**: Load a trained model to test on a specific image or the validation dataset, and save the results.

Installation
------------

To install the FAI-Trainer package, use pip:

    pip install fai-trainer

Usage
-----

### Data Preparation and Model Training

To run both data preparation and model training in sequence:

    fai-trainer --prepare-data --train --batch-size 32 --epochs 3 --image-size 96 96

### Model Testing

To test the model on a specific image:

    fai-trainer --test --image-path path/to/your/image.jpg --image-size 96 96

Directory Structure
-------------------

Ensure your dataset directory has the following structure:

    datasets/
    ├── class1/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── class2/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── class3/
        ├── image1.jpg
        ├── image2.jpg
        └── ...

### Directory Clean up

To clean up any prior processing or training:

    fai-trainer --clean
