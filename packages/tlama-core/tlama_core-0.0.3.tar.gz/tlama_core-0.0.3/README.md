## **How to Set Up Tlama Core** 💻

Get started easily on **Windows**, **Linux**, or **macOS**!

### **Prerequisites**
- **CUDA Toolkit** (GPU support)
- **Python 3.8+** (virtual env recommended)
- **PyTorch** (GPU version preferred)
- **NVIDIA Driver** (GPU-compatible)
- **CMake** (for CUDA kernels)

#### **CUDA Toolkit Setup** 🛠️
- **Windows**: Download from [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and install.
- **Linux**: Use `sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit` or download from [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- **macOS**: CPU-only (no CUDA support).

### **Installation Steps** 🚀
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tlama-core.git
   cd tlama-core
   ```
2. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv tlama-env
   source tlama-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .\tlama-env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Install CUDA Kernels**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```
5. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  # Should output True
   ```

### **Run Tlama 124M Model 🏃‍♂️**
Test it out:
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("eigencore/tlama-124M", trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("eigencore/tlama-124M", trust_remote_code=True)

prompt = "Once upon a time in a distant kingdom..."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
