Introducing AppLLM, AI-powered app developer.

Create your AI application just with your natural language.

And you are able to deploy directly from here.

So here are some examples.

So these are created by AppLLM.

And these are really nice.

You don't need to know coding.

Here is an example where we are providing an instruction on what to build.

So that is the landing page for a party event.

So it automatically created the page for me.

This is really nice.

And you are able to deploy directly from the interface itself.

And I'm going to show you step by step how you can do this

and how easy it is to build application like this.

All of these features included in chat LLM for teams just for $10 per month.

That is really nice.

Because you get all these features of accessing to state-of-the-art large-language models.

These are top-performing models with Internet search, deep research, create image,

create videos, chat with your documents and much more.

AppLLM, CodeLLM and ChatLLM all included with this price.

I'll put the link in the description for you to sign up.

Now let's get started.

So once after you sign up, you'll be presented with a screen like this.

So here you got AppLLM, Operator, AI Engineer and CodeLLM.

So for now I'm going to click AppLLM.

And here is the interface.

So I'm going to give this description.

I want to build a simple calorie and macro tracking app for daily use.

Allowing users to log their food intake and showing a dashboard with visual representation and mobile responsive.

Now clicking Send.

Now we took the instruction and it's now building the app for us.

You should be able to track the progress here on the left hand side.

So first it goes to Planning phase.

Then it's creating all the required files, building the application and running the application.

At the end you get a U order like this.

So if you want to preview the window, you can just click the preview button and your app you can preview directly here.

You are able to change the responsiveness.

This is the mobile version, also PowerPoint version.

So you can try all this responsiveness.

You are able to download the code directly by clicking this icon at the top.

You're able to preview a full screen like this.

These are really nice.

So let's try open this application.

So I'm clicking this URL.

So here is the application.

This is really nice.

You can see the daily progress, macro distribution, logging the foot.

So I'm going to add calories, 100 protein grams and fat grams and add the food.

As soon as you add you can see your daily progress is changing.

I can add furthermore and as soon as you add that you can see the progress here.

It changes.

Now I want to make few modification.

Add the list of few items which I'm adding here.

So I'm going to say logging foot should contain the name of the food.

Also the food need to be stored and displayed on screen and clicking send.

Now it's again making the required modification.

As you can see here, it automatically adding the extra code.

Now I got the updated app.

Let's preview this application.

So I've got the option to enter food name here.

Just adding the food name, calories, protein, carbs and fat, adding the food.

And I can clearly see the food item getting stored as per our request.

That is really nice.

Let's try deleting it and I'm able to delete it.

So this is all really nice.

If you find any issues with this page, just right click inspect the element and in the console you should be able to see any error message.

So if any error, just copy the error message which is shown here.

Then you can paste that in this box.

So it understands the real issue and fix the error.

Similarly, if any of the buttons or icons doesn't work in this UI, you can just let the AI knows about that.

And it goes and automatically fix those issues.

And finally, one click deployment.

So I'm going to click deploy.

I got the deployed to production here.

So I'm going to type calorie tracker and deploy.

Seems like the host name already in use.

Let me try calorie tracker too.

So yeah, I've got the app deployed in this URL.

So I'm going to open it.

And now I can see that application in that URL as you can see here.

This is really nice.

Do let me know in the comments below what you think about this.

Considering you already like chat LLM, I also created another video.

It's about code LLM which I recently created, which I highly recommend for you to watch because this features is included in that $10.

So do watch that and I will see you there.
