- `claudebook mcp <runbook>` should have a similar CLI to `claude mcp` but operates on the runbook
- Figure out (non-MCP) tools and how to configure them
- Add argument support (e.g. args for the claudebook itself)
- Add self-improvement commands / other "meta" commands
- Format TOML
- pre-push hook to run (leightweight) tests
