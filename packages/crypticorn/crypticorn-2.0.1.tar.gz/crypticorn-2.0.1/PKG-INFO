```

If you want the latest version, which could be a pre release, run:

```

## Usage

As of know the library is available in async mode only. There are two was of using it.

## With Async Context Protocol
```python
async with ApiClient(base_url="http://localhost", jwt=jwt) as client:
        # json response
        response = await client.pay.products.get_products_without_preload_content()
        print(await response.json())
        # serialized response with pydantic models
        response = await client.pay.products.get_products()
        print(response)
        # json response with http info
        response = await client.pay.products.get_products_with_http_info()
        print(response)
```

## Without Async Context Protocol
Without the context you need to close the session manually.
```python
client = ApiClient(base_url="http://localhost", jwt=jwt)
response = asyncio.run(client.hive.models.get_all_models())
asyncio.run(client.close())
```
