## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Email Access Management**:
   * Team email addresses should be configured as groups in Google Workspace
   * Individual account permissions should follow the principle of least privilege
   * Regular access audits should be conducted quarterly

2. **Response Time Expectations**:
   * All customer-facing emails should have auto-responders stating expected response time
   * The listed response times are maximum targets - teams should strive to respond sooner
   * Establish escalation paths for urgent inquiries

3. **Email Templates**:
   * Standard templates should be used for common responses
   * Templates are maintained in the [Email Templates Repository](../templates/email-templates.md)
   * All templates should be version-controlled and follow the LightWave brand guidelines

4. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   * Email metrics should be tracked and reported monthly
   * Response time compliance should be included in team KPIs
   * Customer satisfaction scores should be collected after support interactions

5. **Security Practices**:
   * Use strong, unique passwords for all email accounts
   * Enable two-factor authentication where available
   * Regular security training for all staff with email access
   * Email signing and encryption for sensitive communications

6. **Archiving Policy**:
   * All business communications must be retained for 7 years
   * Email archiving is managed through Google Vaul
   * Legal hold procedures must be followed when required
