          requirements:
            - "Bug fixes include integration tests to verify resolution"
    
    continuous_updates:
      activities:
        - "Status updates on ClickUp integration are shared with all dependent teams"
        - "ClickUp API version changes are monitored and documented in Release Notes"
        - "Integration health metrics are part of the daily stand-up reports"

  technical_implementation:
    recommendation:
      option: "Dedicated lightwave-integrations-service"
      rationale: "If the ClickUp integration is complex, might eventually involve other external services (Slack, Google Calendar etc.), and needs to be called on-demand by potentially multiple internal services, a dedicated microservice focused purely on external integrations will be cleaner."
      certainty: "High (ClickUp will 100% be complex/multi-use)"
    
    structure:
      repository:
        name: "lightwave-integrations-service"
        visibility: "private"
        type: "Django service"
      
      dependencies:
        - "lightwave-shared-core"
      
      components:
        - "ClickUp client logic"
        - "Internal API (e.g., /integrations/clickup/tasks)"
      
      usage:
        description: "Services like createos-io or cineos-io would make direct API calls (likely routed via the lightwave-api-gateway for consistency and security) to this lightwave-integrations-service whenever they need to interact with ClickUp."

    alternatives:
      - name: "Inside the Primary Consuming Application"
        description: "Direct implementation within createos-io"
        recommendation: "Use Cautiously"
        rationale: "If the only place you anticipate needing to talk to ClickUp is directly within createos-io (e.g., a user clicks a button in CreateOS to push data to ClickUp) and the logic is relatively simple, you could place it there."
        structure:
          - "Within the createos-io repository, create a new Django app, perhaps named integrations or clickup_client"
          - "This app contains the ClickUp API client code"
          - "Views or tasks within other apps in the createos-io project can import and use this client code"
        downsides:
          - "Tightly couples the ClickUp integration to createos-io"
          - "If cineos-io later needs it, you'll have duplicated code or need to refactor"
          - "Deploying createos-io involves deploying the ClickUp integration code, even if only unrelated parts of CreateOS changed"

    excluded_locations:
      - name: "lightwave-shared-core"
        reason: "This is a library, not a place for specific external API clients or runnable code"
      - name: "lightwave-api-gateway"
        reason: "The gateway routes requests; it shouldn't be making outgoing calls to business-logic APIs like ClickUp"
      - name: "lightwave"
        reason: "Unless the only interaction is manual via the CLI"

    implementation_steps:
      - name: "Create the New Service Repo"
        description: "Set up the Django/FastAPI project structure"
      
      - name: "Add ClickUp Client Library"
        description: "Add a Python ClickUp client library (e.g., clickupython) to your service's dependencies (requirements.in)"
      
      - name: "Write Client Wrapper"
        description: "Create module for lightwave-shared-core -- Python module within the service that wraps the ClickUp client library"
        benefits:
          - "Present a simpler interface tailored to your needs"
          - "Makes it easier to swap the underlying library later if needed"

        warnings:
          - "Never commit secrets to Git"
      
      - name: "Define Interface"
        description: "Create clear API specification"
        options:
          - "If Automation Service: Define the message formats it expects or the internal API endpoints it exposes for triggering actions"
          - "If Integrations Service: Define the OpenAPI specification for its internal API"
      
      - name: "Deploy"
        description: "Set up its independent CI/CD pipeline"
      
    conclusion:
      summary: "By keeping the ClickUp integration separate, you maintain the modularity of your ecosystem and make it easier to manage changes and dependencies."
