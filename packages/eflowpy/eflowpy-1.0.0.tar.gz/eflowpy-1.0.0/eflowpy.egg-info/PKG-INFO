# eflowpy

**eflowpy** is a Python package for estimating environmental flow requirements using hydrological methods based on streamflow time series data. It provides a consistent and extensible interface for calculating commonly used flow-based environmental indicators.

## Features

- Calculate environmental flow recommendations using:
  - Tennant Method
  - Flow Duration Curve (FDC)
  - GEFC (Generalized Environmental Flow Criteria)
  - 7Q10 Method
  - Tessman Method
- Built-in plotting support:
  - Time series plots
  - Flow threshold overlays

## Installation
To install `eflowpy` from PyPI:
```bash
pip install eflowpy
```
---

## How to Use

### Quick Start Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from eflowpy.hydrological.tennant import Tennant
from eflowpy.utils.data_reader import read_streamflow_data

# Load streamflow time series from file
flow_series = read_streamflow_data("gauge_12013059_daily.csv", folder="path/to/your/data")

# Run Tennant method
tennant = Tennant(flow_series)
tennant.print_summary()
result = tennant.calculate()
print(result)

# Plot bar chart and streamflow overlay
tennant.plot()
tennant.plot_with_levels()
```
