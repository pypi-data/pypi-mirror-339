# Thermalift

**Calculator for eliminating the thermal lift effect from production data in geothermal wells.**

Thermalift was developed as part of the [GeoModel](https://geomodel.pl/en/) project.

The user's guide can be found in the docs directory or [here](https://github.com/maciejmiecznik/thermalift/blob/main/docs/Thermalift_1.0_user_guide.pdf)


The output from Thermalift calculator can be a figure similar to the below one, showing how thermal lift influences the observed water table level or water table drawdown.
