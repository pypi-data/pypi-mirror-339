# Performance Profiling and Optimization Guide

This document explains how to use the performance profiling and optimization tools for the ipfs_kit_py library.

## Overview

We've created two powerful tools for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in the ipfs_kit_py library:

1. **performance_profiling.py**: Analyzes and benchmarks key operations in the library
2. **performance_optimizations.py**: Implements identified optimizations automatically

These tools work together to create a systematic approach to performance tuning.

## Performance Profiling

The profiling tool runs comprehensive benchmarks on core operations in the ipfs_kit_py library, including:

- Content addition operations (ipfs_add)
- Content retrieval operations (ipfs_cat)
- Tiered cache performance
- API operation overhead

### Running the Profiler

Basic usage:

```bash
python examples/performance_profiling.py
```

This will run all profiling tests with default settings and save results to a timestamped directory under examples/.

#### Advanced Options

```
usage: performance_profiling.py [-h] [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--iterations ITERATIONS] [--file-sizes FILE_SIZES] [--no-metrics]
                               [--test {all,add,cat,cache,api}]

Performance profiling for ipfs_kit_py

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory to store results (default: examples/profile_results_TIMESTAMP)
  --iterations ITERATIONS
                        Number of iterations for each test (default: 10)
  --file-sizes FILE_SIZES
                        Comma-separated list of file sizes in bytes to test (default: 1024,10240,102400,1048576)
  --no-metrics          Disable detailed metrics collection
  --test {all,add,cat,cache,api}
                        Specific test to run (default: all)
```

### Example: Running Specific Tests

To profile only the add operation with more iterations:

```bash
python examples/performance_profiling.py --test add --iterations 20
```

To profile cache performance with custom file sizes:

```bash
python examples/performance_profiling.py --test cache --file-sizes 1024,524288,5242880
```

### Interpreting Results

The profiling tool generates a comprehensive report with:

1. Timing statistics for each operation
2. Comparative analysis of low-level vs. high-level API
3. Caching performance metrics
4. Optimization recommendations

Results are saved both as printed output to the console and as a detailed JSON file for further analysis.

Performance Optimization Recommendations:
  1. High-level API has significant overhead. Consider:
     - Reducing validation in high-level API methods
     - Adding caching for frequently called methods
     - Optimizing error handling paths
  2. Cache performance can be improved:
     - Increase memory cache size to improve hit rates
  3. Content addition performance:
     - Implement chunked uploads for large files (>100KB)

## Performance Optimization

The optimization tool implements the recommendations identified by the profiling tool, applying changes to the codebase automatically.

### Running the Optimizer

Basic usage:

```bash
python examples/performance_optimizations.py
```

This will apply all optimizations based on general best practices. For better results, use with profiling data:

```bash
python examples/performance_optimizations.py --profile-results examples/profile_results_20230402_123456/profiling_results.json
```

### Applied Optimizations

The tool implements several key optimizations:

1. **High-level API Improvements**:
   - Adds caching for frequently called methods
   - Reduces unnecessary validation and error handling overhead

2. **Cache Configuration Enhancements**:
   - Increases memory cache size for better hit rates
   - Optimizes ARC algorithm parameters for better caching efficiency

3. **Chunked Upload Implementation**:
   - Adds chunked upload capability for large files
   - Automatically redirects large file uploads to the chunked implementation
   - Implements corresponding chunked retrieval functionality

### Measuring Improvement

After applying optimizations, run the profiling tool again to measure the improvements:

```bash
# Run the profiler again
python examples/performance_profiling.py

# Compare with previous results
python examples/compare_profiles.py --before examples/profile_results_before/profiling_results.json --after examples/profile_results_after/profiling_results.json
```

## Performance Best Practices

For ongoing development, consider these performance best practices:

1. **Use the Tiered Cache System**:
   - The tiered cache provides significant speedups for repeated access patterns
   - Configure memory cache size appropriately for your workload
   - Consider the access patterns of your application when optimizing caching

2. **Large Content Handling**:
   - Use chunked uploads for files larger than 1MB
   - Consider streaming APIs for very large files
   - Be mindful of memory usage when handling large content

3. **API Selection**:
   - Use the low-level API for maximum performance in critical code paths
   - Use the high-level API for convenience and safety in most application code
   - The filesystem API provides excellent performance for repeated access patterns

4. **Regular Profiling**:
   - Run performance profiling regularly to catch regressions
   - Profile with realistic workloads that match your use case
   - Consider automating performance testing in CI/CD pipelines

## Customizing Optimizations

The optimization tool is designed to be non-destructive and maintainable. If you want to customize or extend the optimizations:

1. Edit the `PerformanceOptimizer` class in `performance_optimizations.py`
2. Add new optimization methods following the existing pattern
3. Add your custom methods to the `apply_all_optimizations` function

Each optimization method follows a clear pattern:
- Load the target file
- Make targeted modifications
- Save the modified file
- Return success/failure status

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for the performance tools:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Add options for parallel execution of chunked uploads
2. **Memory Profiling**: Add memory usage analysis to identify memory bottlenecks
3. **Continuous Profiling**: Add support for long-running profiling to identify issues over time
4. **Profile Comparison**: Create visualization tools for comparing before/after profiles
5. **Custom Workloads**: Add support for defining custom workload patterns that match specific use cases
