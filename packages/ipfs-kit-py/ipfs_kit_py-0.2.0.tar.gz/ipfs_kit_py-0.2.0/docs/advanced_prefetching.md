# Advanced Prefetching Strategies

Beyond the standard tiered caching mechanisms (LRU, LFU, ARC), `ipfs-kit-py` implements advanced prefetching strategies to proactively load content into the cache before it's explicitly requested. These strategies aim to improve performance by anticipating user needs based on content type, access patterns, and relationships between data.

The core components are found in `content_aware_prefetch.py` and `predictive_prefetching.py`.

## Overview

Advanced prefetching goes beyond simple caching by trying to predict *what* content will be needed next and loading it preemptively.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Content-Aware Prefetching**: Analyzes the type (MIME type, detected format) and metadata of accessed content to determine an appropriate prefetching strategy (e.g., load subsequent chunks for video, load related files for archives).
*   **Predictive Prefetching**: Learns from historical access patterns to predict future requests.
    *   **Markov Models**: Model sequential access patterns (e.g., if A is accessed, then B is likely next).
    *   **Graph Relationship Models**: Model relationships between content items (e.g., if document A cites document B, prefetch B when A is accessed).
*   **Resource Monitoring Integration**: Prefetching decisions consider current system resource availability (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to avoid overwhelming the system.

## Implementation

### Content-Aware Prefetching (`ContentAwarePrefetchManager`)

*   **`ContentTypeAnalyzer`**: Detects content type based on metadata (e.g., filename extension, `mime_type` property) or magic bytes. Provides default prefetching strategies based on type (e.g., "sequential chunking" for video, "load all related" for small archives).
*   **`ContentAwarePrefetchManager`**: Orchestrates the process. When content is accessed:
    1.  Records the access event.
    2.  Uses `ContentTypeAnalyzer` to determine the content type and initial strategy.
    3.  Considers current resource availability (`ResourceMonitor`).
    4.  Potentially consults `PredictivePrefetchingEngine` for refined predictions.
    5.  Schedules prefetch tasks for candidate CIDs using the `TieredCacheManager`.

### Predictive Prefetching (`PredictivePrefetchingEngine`)

*   **`MarkovPrefetchModel`**: Learns transition probabilities between accessed CIDs (e.g., P(B|A) - probability of accessing B after A). Predicts likely next accesses based on the current access.
*   **`GraphRelationshipModel`**: Builds a graph where nodes are CIDs and edges represent relationships (e.g., "cites", "part_of", "linked_from"). Predicts related content based on graph proximity.
*   **`PredictivePrefetchingEngine`**: Combines inputs from Markov models, graph models, and potentially content type analysis to generate a ranked list of prefetch candidates. Persists learned models to disk.

## Configuration

Advanced prefetching features are typically configured under `cache.prefetching` or similar keys:

```python
# Example configuration snippet
config = {
    'cache': {
        # ... other cache settings (tiered cache sizes etc.)
        'prefetching': {
            'enabled': True,
            'strategy': 'hybrid', # 'content_aware', 'predictive', 'hybrid'
            'max_concurrent_prefetches': 5,
            'max_queue_size': 100,
            'resource_aware': True, # Consider system load before prefetching
            'content_aware': {
                'enable_magic_detection': True,
                'default_strategies': { # Example strategies per type
                    'video/mp4': {'type': 'sequential_chunking', 'ahead': 3},
                    'application/zip': {'type': 'load_related', 'max_size_mb': 50},
                    'text/html': {'type': 'load_linked_assets', 'depth': 1},
                    'default': {'type': 'none'}
                }
            },
            'predictive': {
                'markov_order': 2,
                'graph_decay_factor': 0.1,
                'model_persist_path': '~/.ipfs_kit/prefetch_models',
                'min_confidence_threshold': 0.3 # Minimum prediction confidence to prefetch
            }
        }
    }
    # ... other ipfs-kit-py config
}
```

## Workflow Example

1.  User requests `CID_A` (e.g., a video file).
2.  `TieredCacheManager` handles the request. If it's a cache miss, it fetches the content.
3.  After successful retrieval, `TieredCacheManager` notifies the `ContentAwarePrefetchManager` (if enabled).
4.  `ContentAwarePrefetchManager` records the access to `CID_A`.
5.  It uses `ContentTypeAnalyzer` to identify `CID_A` as `video/mp4`. The default strategy might be "sequential chunking".
6.  It consults `PredictivePrefetchingEngine`:
    *   Markov model checks history: Was `CID_A` often followed by `CID_B`?
    *   Graph model checks relationships: Is `CID_A` part of a playlist linking to `CID_C`?
7.  The engine combines these signals (content type strategy, Markov prediction, graph relationships) and generates candidate CIDs (e.g., next video chunk `CID_A_chunk2`, predicted next video `CID_B`, related playlist item `CID_C`).
8.  `ContentAwarePrefetchManager` checks resource availability via `ResourceMonitor`.
9.  If resources permit, it schedules prefetch tasks for high-confidence candidates (e.g., `CID_A_chunk2`, `CID_B`) via the `TieredCacheManager`.
10. `TieredCacheManager` fetches `CID_A_chunk2` and `CID_B` into the cache in the background.
11. When the user requests `CID_A_chunk2` or `CID_B`, it results in a cache hit, improving performance.

## Benefits

*   **Reduced Latency**: Content is often already in the cache when requested.
*   **Improved User Experience**: Smoother playback for sequential media, faster loading of related content.
*   **Adaptive Performance**: Learns from user behavior to optimize future requests.
*   **Network Efficiency**: Can reduce redundant requests by prefetching related content bundles.

## Considerations

*   **Resource Consumption**: Prefetching consumes extra bandwidth, CPU (for prediction), and cache space. Needs careful tuning and resource awareness.
*   **Prediction Accuracy**: Inaccurate predictions can lead to wasted resources fetching unused content. Models need sufficient historical data to become accurate.
*   **Complexity**: More complex than simple caching algorithms. Requires monitoring and potentially tuning of prediction models.
*   **Cold Start**: Predictive models need time to learn access patterns; performance improves over time.
