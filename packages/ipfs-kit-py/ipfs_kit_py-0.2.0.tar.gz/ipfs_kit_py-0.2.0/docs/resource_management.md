# Resource Management in ipfs-kit-py

`ipfs-kit-py` includes a sophisticated resource management system designed to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) and adapt the library's behavior accordingly. This ensures optimal performance and stability under varying system loads.

The core components are:

*   **`ResourceMonitor`**: Periodically checks system resource usage (CPU load, memory usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth) and maintains a history. It provides recommendations for thread pool sizes, cache allocations, and identifies potential system bottlenecks.
*   **`AdaptiveThreadPool`**: A thread pool implementation that dynamically adjusts its size based on feedback from the `ResourceMonitor` and task queue length, optimizing throughput and resource utilization.
*   **`ResourceAdapter`**: Acts as an intermediary, applying the recommendations from the `ResourceMonitor` to other components like the `TieredCacheManager`, prefetching engines, and thread pools.

## Configuration

Resource management features can be configured through the main `ipfs-kit-py` configuration under a `resource_management` key.

```python
# Example configuration snippet
config = {
    'resource_management': {
        'enabled': True,
        'monitor_interval_seconds': 15,
        'cpu_threshold_high': 85.0, # Percentage
        'memory_threshold_high': 90.0, # Percentage
        'disk_threshold_high': 95.0, # Percentage
        'network_threshold_mbps': 1000, # Megabits per second
        'history_duration_minutes': 60,
        'adaptive_thread_pool': {
            'min_threads': 2,
            'max_threads_factor': 1.5, # Multiplier of CPU cores
            'target_queue_latency_ms': 100,
            'adjustment_interval_seconds': 30
        },
        'adaptive_cache': {
            'target_memory_usage_factor': 0.7, # Target 70% of available memory for cache
            'min_cache_size_mb': 100
        }
        # ... other potential configurations
    }
    # ... other ipfs-kit-py config
}

from ipfs_kit_py.high_level_api import IPFSSimpleAPI
kit = IPFSSimpleAPI(config=config)
```

## Usage

Resource management typically operates automatically in the background when enabled. You can interact with it primarily through:

1.  **Enabling/Disabling**: Via the main configuration.
2.  **Accessing Status/Metrics**: The `ResourceMonitor` (if accessed directly or via a helper method) can provide current status and historical data.
3.  **Observing Effects**: Noticing changes in cache size, thread pool activity, or potentially throttled operations under high load.
