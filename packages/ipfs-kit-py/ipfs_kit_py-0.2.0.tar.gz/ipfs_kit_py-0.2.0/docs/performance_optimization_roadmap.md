# ParquetCIDCache Performance Optimization Roadmap

This document outlines planned performance optimizations for the ParquetCIDCache implementation in the TieredCacheManager system.

## High-Priority Performance Optimizations

The ParquetCIDCache implementation offers several opportunities for substantial performance improvements:

### 1. Batch Operations
- Implement `batch_get()` and `batch_put()` methods to process multiple CIDs at once
- Reduce overhead for bulk operations by amortizing system calls and I/O operations
- Enable efficient processing of dataset operations rather than individual items
- Design considerations:
  - Balance batch size with memory utilization
  - Implement retries and partial success handling
  - Provide asynchronous batch interfaces

### 2. Zero-Copy Access
- Extend the current Arrow C Data Interface implementation for cross-process sharing
- Implement shared memory regions for large dataset access between processes
- Reduce redundant data copying between cache tiers and processes
- Enhance the existing Plasma store integration
- Optimize for resource-constrained environments with memory mapping

### 3. Async Operations
- Add async versions of all cache methods (`async_get()`, `async_put()`, etc.)
- Implement non-blocking I/O for Parquet operations
- Create background worker pools for I/O-bound operations
- Provide compatibility with asyncio-based applications
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations

### 4. Intelligent Cache Management
- Implement predictive cache eviction based on access pattern modeling
- Add content relationship-aware caching (cache related items together)
- Develop workload-specific optimization profiles
- Create learning-based cache management policies
- Add time-based and frequency-based cache invalidation

### 5. Read-Ahead Prefetching
- Implement intelligent prefetching for commonly accessed content patterns
- Add content-aware prefetching based on semantic relationships
- Create adaptive prefetching strategies based on workload detection
- Implement content streaming with prefetching
- Optimize for network latency minimization

### 6. Compression and Encoding Optimization
- Fine-tune Parquet compression settings based on metadata characteristics
- Implement dictionary encoding for repeated values in metadata
- Add run-length encoding for sequential or repetitive data patterns
- Create specialized encodings for CID-specific data
- Optimize for different storage tiers (memory vs. disk)

### 7. Schema and Column Optimization
- Implement per-workload schema optimization based on access patterns
- Add column pruning for unused or rarely accessed fields
- Create specialized indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement schema evolution for backwards compatibility
- Add statistical metadata collection for schema optimization

### 8. Advanced Partitioning Strategies
- Implement time-based partitioning for temporal access patterns
- Add size-based partitioning to balance partition sizes
- Create content-type based partitioning for workload specialization
- Add hash-based partitioning for even distribution
- Implement dynamic partition management

### 9. Parallel Query Execution
- Implement multi-threaded query execution for complex analytical operations
- Add partition-parallel scanning for large datasets
- Create worker pools for compute-intensive operations
- Optimize thread allocation based on query complexity
- Implement query planning for efficient execution paths

### 10. Probabilistic Data Structures
- Implement Bloom filters for fast negative lookups
- Add HyperLogLog for cardinality estimation
- Create Count-Min Sketch for frequency estimation in large datasets
- Implement Cuckoo filters for improved false positive rates
- Add MinHash for similarity estimation

## Implementation Priorities

1. **First Phase (Quick Wins)**
   - Batch operations for get/put
   - Basic async interfaces
   - Improved compression settings

2. **Second Phase (Structural Improvements)**
   - Zero-copy access with Arrow C Data Interface
   - Advanced partitioning strategies
   - Parallel query execution

3. **Third Phase (Advanced Features)**
   - Intelligent cache management
   - Read-ahead prefetching
   - Probabilistic data structures

## Benchmarking and Evaluation

All optimizations will be evaluated using standardized benchmarks:

- **Throughput**: Operations per second under various workloads
- **Latency**: P50, P90, P99 response times
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, and I/O utilization
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing dataset sizes
- **Concurrency**: Behavior under parallel access patterns

Each optimization will be documented with before/after performance metrics to quantify improvements.
