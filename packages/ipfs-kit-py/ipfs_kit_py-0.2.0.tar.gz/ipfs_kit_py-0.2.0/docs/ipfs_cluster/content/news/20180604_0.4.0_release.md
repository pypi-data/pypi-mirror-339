## 20180604 | Release 0.4.0 | @hsanjuan

Last week we released IPFS Cluster v0.4.0.

We bumped the minor version number to make explicit not only that we brought on a lot of new things, but that this release also included a number of breaking changes, mostly in regards to the configuration file.

The [changelog](https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) gives an overview of what's new (a lot of things!), but we will also take time to explore and explain the changes in more detail right in this news section, in separate upcoming entries.

For the moment, this release is a solid milestone and provides essential features and fixes for production deployments. It is so far running very smoothly in our storage cluster. This website and [the documentation pages](/documentation), on which we have put significant efforts, should help users install, configure, deploy and tune their Clusters. If you encounter a problem or need help, just reach out!
