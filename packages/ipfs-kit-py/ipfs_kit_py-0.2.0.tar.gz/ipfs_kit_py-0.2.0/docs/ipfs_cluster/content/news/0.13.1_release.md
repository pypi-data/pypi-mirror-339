## 20210114 | Release 0.13.1 and current state of the project

We just released
[IPFS Cluster 0.13.1](https://github.com/ipfs-cluster/ipfs-cluster/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md),
with some bugfixes, dependency upgrades and a couple of improvements.

While development efforts have been moved to other parts of the ecosystem in
the last few months, the IPFS Project continues being maintained, although
without active development of large features. What users can expect is:

* [Support](/support/) over the common channels, responses to issues etc.
* Bugfixes and pull request reviews.
* Dependency upgrades and project maintenance, with a slow but stable release candence.

IPFS Cluster continues to be used in production to replicate and distribute
important data hosted on IPFS. Happy pinning!
