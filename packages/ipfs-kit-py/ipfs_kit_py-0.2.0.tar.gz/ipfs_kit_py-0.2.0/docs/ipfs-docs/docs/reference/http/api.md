# HTTP APIs

<!--

This page is provided for backward-compatibility,
ensuring existing hotlinks to our docs remain functional.

Most of users won't ever see this, because this.advancedRedirect() in
.vuepress/theme/components/Page.vue will detect references starting with
#api-v0-foo and will redirect to correct URL at /reference/kubo/rpc/#api-v0-foo

In case when RPC reference page was linked without an anchor, below two links
should be enough.

-->

- [HTTP Gateway](../../reference/http/gateway.md): implementation-agnostic interface for retrieving [content-addressed](../../concepts/glossary.md#content-addressing) data from IPFS
- [Kubo RPC API v0](../../reference/kubo/rpc.md): RPC for managing Kubo IPFS nodes
