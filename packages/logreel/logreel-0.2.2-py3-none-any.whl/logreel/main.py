    """
    Custom FastAPI lifespan context manager.

    This function manages the application's lifecycle, including the initialisation and cleanup of critical resources
    like the 'Collector' instance. Throughout the all application, there's only one singleton instance of 'Collector'.
    It is used to define setup and teardown tasks that are executed by the 'Collector' at the application
    startup and shutdown, respectively.

    Args:
         fast_api_app (FastAPI): The FastAPI application instance

    Yields:
        None: Yields control back to FastAPI to run its event loop while maintaining the setup resources.

    Lifecycle:
        - **Startup**:
            - Instantiates and initialises the 'Collector' instance.
            - Calls 'coll_start' to perform the async create_task that runs in the background of the FastAPI application.

        -**Shutdown**:
            - Calls 'coll_stop' to clean up resources and shutdown the background tasks.
