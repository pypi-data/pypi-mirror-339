    "description": "The CALCE CX2 database was generated by conducting aging tests on CX2 cell batteries. These batteries have a rated capacity of 1100 mAh. During testing, all cells underwent the same charging profile: they were charged at a constant current of 0.5 C until reaching 4.2 V, after which the voltage was maintained at 4.2 V until the charging current dropped below 0.05 A. The discharge cut-off voltage for these batteries was set at 2.7 V. Each CS2 cell was cycled multiple times under these conditions and tested using the Arbin Battery Tester.",
