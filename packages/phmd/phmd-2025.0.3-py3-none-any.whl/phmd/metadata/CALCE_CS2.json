    "description": "To generate this dataset, aging tests were conducted on several CS2 cell batteries with a rated capacity of 1100 mAh. All cells underwent identical charging procedures: they were charged at a constant current of 0.5 C until reaching 4.2 V, after which the voltage was maintained at 4.2 V until the charging current dropped below 0.05 A. The discharge cut-off voltage for these batteries was set at 2.7 V. Each CS2 cell underwent multiple cycles under these conditions and was tested using the Arbin Battery Tester.",
