    "description": "The dataset was generated from an experimental setup following a \"Factorial 5 x 3\" design, aimed at examining the performance of a bearing under various conditions. Five distinct failure levels (F0, F1, F2, F3, F4) were investigated across three operational regimes, characterized by rotational speeds of 200, 350, and 500 rpm. The \"F0\" level represents the normal state of the bearing, while the other levels (F1 to F4) indicate progressively induced failures, with depths measured at 0.006, 0.014, 0.019, and 0.027 mm, respectively. Each combination was repeated three times. Accelerometers were strategically placed in the load area of the supports and the clamping tower to capture relevant vibration data. Each recording spans 30 seconds, sampled at a frequency of 40 kHz. The dataset includes data from three accelerometers, with one specifically monitoring the bearing undergoing induced failure, providing comprehensive insights into the bearing's behavior under different failure scenarios and operational conditions.",
