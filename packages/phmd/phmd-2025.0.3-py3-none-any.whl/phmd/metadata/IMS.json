    "description": "The dataset was obtained from the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati and originated from a run-to-failure experiment featuring four bearings mounted on a loaded shaft weighing 6000 lbs and rotating at a constant speed of 2000 rpm. Three distinct subsets make up the dataset: the first set utilizes two high-precision accelerometers per bearing, while the second and third sets employ only one accelerometer. In this study, the second and third datasets, each containing four signal inputs from accelerometers, were utilized. Overall, there are three distinct experimental units present across the two sets.",

A radial load of 6000 lbs. is added to the shaft and bearing by a spring mechanism. All the bearings are force lubricated. An oil circulation system regulates the flow and the temperature of the lubricant. A magnetic plug installed in the oil feedback pipe collects debris from the oil as evidence of bearing degradation. The test will stop when the accumulated debris adhered to the magnetic plug exceeds a certain level and causes an electrical switch to close.",
