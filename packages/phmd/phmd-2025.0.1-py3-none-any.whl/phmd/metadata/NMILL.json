    "description": "The NMILL dataset captures experiments conducted on a milling machine, focusing on investigating tool wear under diverse operating conditions, as outlined by Goebel in 1996. These experiments encompass regular cuts, as well as entry and exit cuts. Data were collected using three types of sensors: acoustic emission sensors, vibration sensors, and current sensors, positioned at various locations.\n\nWith 16 cases in total, the number of runs varied based on the extent of flank wear, which was measured intermittently up to a specified wear limit, and sometimes beyond. Flank wear measurements were not consistently taken, resulting in occasional gaps in the data. Prior to data acquisition, sensor signals underwent amplification and filtering, followed by processing through two root mean square (RMS) stages before being recorded by the computer.",
