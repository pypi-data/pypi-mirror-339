    "description": "The benchmark dataset for condition monitoring of rolling bearings, developed by Paderborn University, consists of 32 bearings, all of the 6203 type, characterized by dimensions of 17X40X12mm for inner diameter, outer diameter, and width, respectively. Among these bearings, 6 are in a healthy state, 12 have been intentionally damaged using drilling, EDM, and electric engraving machines to induce defects in both inner and outer races, while the remaining 14 exhibit natural damage from accelerated lifetime tests.\n\nThe test rig underwent various operating conditions to evaluate the robustness of condition monitoring (CM) methods across different scenarios. Key operational parameters included the rotational speed of the drive system, radial force applied to the test bearing, and load torque in the drive train, all maintained at fixed levels for consistency across experiments. Initially, in set no. 0, the rig operated at n = 1,500 rpm with a load torque of M = 0.7 Nm and a radial force of F = 1,000 N. Subsequently, three additional settings were employed, each reducing one parameter: n = 900 rpm, M = 0.1 Nm, and F = 400 N for sets no. 1-3, respectively.\n\nEach setting involved recording 20 measurements, each lasting 4 seconds. Additionally, the temperature during all experiments was maintained at approximately 45-50 \u00b0C. This comprehensive dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating and improving condition monitoring techniques for rolling bearings under varied operating conditions.",
