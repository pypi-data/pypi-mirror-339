    "description": "The dataset, provided by Jiangnan University (JNU), encompasses three sets of bearing vibration data distinguished by different rotating speeds, all sampled at a rate of 50 kHz. Each set comprises one healthy state and three distinct fault modes: inner ring fault, outer ring fault, and rolling element fault. Thus, the dataset encompasses a total of four classes, representing one healthy state and three fault modes. In total, there are 12 experimental units, with half corresponding to the healthy condition and the remaining units evenly distributed among the three fault conditions.",

The motor, a 3.7 kW three-phase induction motor, had specific nameplate details, including Vmax of 220V, 4 pole pairs (P), and a rated speed (S) of 1,800 rpm. The test involved varying rotation speed from 400 to 800 rpm and adjusting the optional input voltage, while the torque on the rotating shaft was manipulated by randomly rubbing the timing belt. Vibration signals were measured using a PCB MA352A60 accelerometer with a bandwidth of 5 Hz to 60 kHz. \n\nThe accelerometer (PCB MA352A60) signals, representing normal and various fault states, were amplified by a PCB ICP Model 480C02 sensor signal conditioner and recorded using a Scope Coder DL750 with a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. Two types of roller bearings, N205 and NU205, were employed for the fault diagnosis test, with N205 used for normal, outer-race defect, and roller element defect states, and NU205 used specifically for the inner-race defect state.\n",
