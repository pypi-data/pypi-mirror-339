    "description": "This dataset was used in the PHM 2013 Data Competition. The objective was create an algorithm and model for recommending maintenance actions on a machine, utilizing machine parameters and events. The specific details about the machine, as well as a description of the parameters and events, have been intentionally omitted by the data suppliers, presumably due to intellectual property considerations.\n\nParameters likely consist of sensor readings measuring physical properties of the machine, such as Temperature, Pressure, Acceleration, Vibration, Velocity, etc. These parameters are continuous readings represented as real (floating point) numbers\n\nEvents are codes generated by the machine's condition monitoring system to identify a known type of machine event. The specifics and descriptions of these events have not been disclosed. However, a typical condition monitoring system is expected to detect events based on threshold exceedances, such as high temperature, high-frequency vibration, low pressure, etc. Events are discrete and are represented by alphanumeric codes.\n\nParameters are recorded when a specific event occurs. Not all possible machine parameters (P01 through P30) are captured for every event type; in other words, only a subset of possible parameters are relevant to a particular event type.\n\nEach cases is categorized with a machine problem or fault.",
