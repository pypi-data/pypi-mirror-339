    "description": "The MFPT dataset, provided by the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology in collaboration with Dr. Eric Bechhoefer, is a valuable resource for studying rolling bearing faults. It consists of three sets of experimental bearing vibration data and three sets of actual fault data. The experimental sets include a baseline set, inner race fault set, and outer race fault set.\n\nThe baseline dataset comprises three files, with data sampled at a frequency of 97656 Hz for 6 seconds under a 270-pound load. The inner race fault dataset contains seven files, sampled at 48828 Hz for 3 seconds under various load conditions ranging from 0 to 300 pounds. Similarly, the outer race fault dataset consists of seven files, sampled at 48828 Hz for 3 seconds under load conditions ranging from 25 to 300 pounds. All data points are collected using a single-channel radial accelerometer.\n\nThe experimental bearings in the MFPT dataset are deep groove ball bearings characterized by a 31.62 mm pitch diameter, a 5.97 mm ball diameter, a 0\u00b0 contact angle, and an element number of 8.",
