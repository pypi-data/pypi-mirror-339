    "description": "In this dataset, from Baidu Inc., all samples were collected from the Seagate ST31000524NS, an enterprise-class hard disk model. The dataset comprises samples from 5,317 different disks, each labeled as either \"good\" or \"failed.\" Among these disks, only 433 were labeled as failed, while the remaining 5,317 were labeled as good. This results in a highly unbalanced dataset, with over 10 times more good disks than failed ones. SMART Attribute values were recorded hourly for each disk. For good disks, samples from a week's period are included in the dataset, resulting in 168 samples per good disk. However, for failed disks, samples from a longer period (20 days before the actual failure) are retained. If a disk failed before the 20-day period, the number of samples may be less than 480. All attribute values are scaled to the interval [-1, 1], and their exact values are withheld.",
