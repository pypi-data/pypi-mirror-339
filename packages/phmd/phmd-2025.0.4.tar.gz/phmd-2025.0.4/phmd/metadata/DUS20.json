    "description": "This dataset originated from a test bench composed of an induction motor, a flywheel, and three ball bearings. This setup enables the replication of various mechanical issues such as bearing failures, shaft misalignment, and unbalanced loads. The primary focus of the study is on diagnosing different levels of unbalance through automatic classification methods. Unbalance was induced by adding screws, nuts, and washers onto the flywheel, simulating five distinct states of unbalance.\n\nAn accelerometer (Bruel Kjaer 43962) was positioned on the right-hand side bearing, and its signal was captured using a DAQ 9233 at a sampling rate of 1000Hz. Twenty data samples were collected for each state of unbalance, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis.",
