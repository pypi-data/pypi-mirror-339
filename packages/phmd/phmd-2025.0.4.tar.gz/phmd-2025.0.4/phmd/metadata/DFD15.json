    "description": "The entire experimentation was performed with 3-AxisCNC EMCO Concept Mill 105. HSS twist drill bit of diameter 9 mm was used for drilling holes in the work piece made of Mild steel. For extensive experimentation, given a drill bit state, for each pair of varying feed rates and cutting speed combinations, a single vibration recording of 8 seconds was taken. Feed rate was varied as 4 mm/min, 8 mm/min and 12 mm/min, and Cutting speed was varied as 160rpm, 170rpm, 180rpm, 190rpm and 200rpm; giving a total of 15 combination pairs.\n",
