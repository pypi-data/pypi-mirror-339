    "description": "The N-CMAPSS dataset, constructed using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) developed at NASA, offers comprehensive flight trajectories from a healthy state to failure. This dataset has gained traction in the field of prognosis and health management (PHM), with various studies proposing solutions to address its challenges. It encompasses seven failure modes related to flow degradation or subcomponent efficiency.\n\nFlights are categorized into three classes based on duration: Class 1 (1 to 3 hours), Class 2 (3 to 5 hours), and Class 3 (over 5 hours). The objective is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system until failure. RUL is assumed to linearly decrease from the maximum value (total cycles of the experiment) to 0. With 20 input time series variables, this constitutes a multivariate regression task.",
