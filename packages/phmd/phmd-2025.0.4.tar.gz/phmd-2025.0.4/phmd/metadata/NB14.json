    "description": "The NASA Randomized dataset includes data from 28 lithium cobalt oxide 18,650 cells with a nominal capacity of 2.2 Ah. These cells underwent continuous charging and discharging cycles with specific profiles. Every 50 cycles, reference charging and discharging cycles were performed to evaluate battery health. The batteries are grouped into 7 categories, each comprising 4 cells, based on the charge/discharge profile and temperature conditions.\n\nDistinct charge/discharge profiles, such as random walk (RW) and skewed RW, where current selection follows a custom probability distribution, are utilized. Batteries operate at either room temperature or 40\u00b0C, depending on the group. Each group exhibits variations in charging duration, discharge voltage, and current sequences, reflecting diverse operational scenarios. This dataset offers valuable insights for analyzing battery performance under various conditions.",
