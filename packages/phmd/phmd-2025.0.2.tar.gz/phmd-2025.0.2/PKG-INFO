The library `phmd` is designed to facilitate access to datasets in the context of industrial prognosis and health management (PHM). The main goal is to streamline automated processing, enabling researchers and practitioners to obtain, manipulate, and analyze data relevant to their work in an easy maner. 

In the realm of predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis, the ability to efficiently search and access relevant datasets is crucial for developing effective machine learning models. The phmd library provides a straightforward method to search through a comprehensive collection of datasets based on specific features or criteria. This functionality allows users to quickly locate datasets that match their needs, enhancing the efficiency of their research and development processes.

This library provides tools for data search, downloading, and loading without concerns about the locations or source formats of the datasets. In a nutshell, the library provides a unified interface for accessing an important number of datasets from diferent sources and heterogeneous format, thereby reducing significantly the time and effort required to prepare datasets for machine learning and other analytical tasks.

### Software functionalities

The main features of the developed software can be summarized as follows:

- **Listing and search**. The library allows users to search for datasets tailored to specific purposes. Each dataset is associated with a set of meta-attributes facilitating the selection of the most suitable dataset for a particular research objective.
- **Automatic download**. The download process is automatically triggered when a dataset is required to load only if it has not been previously downloaded.   
- **Loading**. One of the most important features of this library is its dataset loading capability. The loading functionality abstracts away from source format in which the dataset is originally provided, making it agnostic to the user and allowing them to focus directly on data analysis after loading. The loading functionality accepts the dataset name and the task type as parameters. Based on the specified task, the target variable is automatically computed, and the relevant features are filtered accordingly.


### Installation

You can install `phmd` with pip:

```
pip install phmd
```

or clone this repository and install it in editable mode:

```
git clone https://github.com/dasolma/phmd
cd phmd
pip install -e .
```


### Examples of usage

#### Search datasets

The method *search* of the class *Dataset* allow list of the dataset avaiable or search for datasets that match any criteria.

For example searching for datasets that contain vibration data, users can identify various datasets across different domains and applications, such as mechanical or manufacturing contexts. The following example illustrates how to perform a dataset search using the phmd library, showcasing the relevant details, including dataset names, domains, application areas, task names, and the nature of the data and features provided.

```
>>> import phmd
>>> datasets.Dataset.search(features='vibra')

name    domain        nature      app     task name [target] data nature  features
------- ------------- ----------- ------- ------------------ ------------ --------
CWRU    Mechanical    time-series Bearing Diagnosis [fault]  time-series vibration
DFD15   Manufacturing time-series Drill   Diagnosis [fault]  time-series vibration
DFD15   Manufacturing time-series Drill   Stage  [stage]     time-series vibration

UPM23   Mechanical    time-series Bearing Diagnosis [fault]  time-series vibration
XJTU-SY Mechanical    time-series Bearing Prognosis [rul]    time-series vibration
XJTU-SY Mechanical    time-series Bearing Diagnosis [fault]  time-series vibration
```

### Get information of a dataset

Understanding the specifics of a dataset is vital for effective analysis and model development. The phmd library simplifies this process by providing a straightforward way to retrieve detailed information of the dataset collection. By utilizing the Dataset class, users can obtain comprehensive descriptions, system information, features, tasks, resources, and references associated with a particular dataset.

In the following example, we demonstrate how to access detailed information for the well-known CWRU (Case Western Reserve University) dataset, which focuses on bearing fault diagnosis. The output includes essential details such as the dataset's description, the types of sensors used, the nature of the data, and storage requirements. This allows users to evaluate the dataset's suitability for their specific applications and research needs.

```
>>> from phmd import datasets
>>> ds = datasets.Dataset("CWRU")
>>> print(ds.describe())

### Load a dataset

Loading a dataset is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning workflow. The phmd library streamlines this process, allowing users to effortlessly load datasets and access relevant tasks and features. In this example, we demonstrate how to load the CWRU dataset.

By initializing the Dataset class with the dataset name, users can retrieve specific tasks associated with the dataset. In this case, we access the 'fault' task for analysis. The subsequent command loads the first dataset subset associated with this task.

```
>>> ds = datasets.Dataset("CWRU")
>>> task = ds['fault']
>>> sets = task[0]

Dataset CWRU already downloaded and extracted
