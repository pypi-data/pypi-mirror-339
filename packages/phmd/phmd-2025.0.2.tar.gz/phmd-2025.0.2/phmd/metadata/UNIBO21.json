    "description": "The UNIBO Powertools Dataset was collected in laboratory tests conducted by an Italian equipment manufacturer. These tests aimed to evaluate various cells intended for use in cleaning equipment such as vacuum cleaners and automated floor cleaners. The dataset, comprising 27 batteries, encompasses batteries from different manufacturers and cells with varying nominal capacities. Cycling was continued until the cell reached the end-of-life stage, providing insights into its performance at different lifespan intervals.",
