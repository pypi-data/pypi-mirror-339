    "description": "This acoustic dataset was collected on a single stage reciprocating type air compressor placed at the Department of Electrical Engineering Workshop. The signals are collected using unidirectional microphones. All acoustic recordings are acquired for a period of 5 seconds at a 50 kHz sampling rate, and the sampled values of the recording are stored in 24 Bit PCM format in.dat files. Thus each recording has a total of 250,000 samples.",
