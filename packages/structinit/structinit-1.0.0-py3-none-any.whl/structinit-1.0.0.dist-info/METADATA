# 🛠️ projinit

`projinit` is a simple Python CLI tool to generate project folder structures from a markdown blueprint (like `structure.md`).

Instead of manually creating folders and files every time, define your project structure once — and let `projinit` scaffold it for you instantly.

## 🚀 Features
