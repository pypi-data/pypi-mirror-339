<!-- Repository with a mondular gym environment, which lets you build a multi-objective water simulations to train you MORL agents on. -->
Welcome to morl4water, a flexible gym environment designed for simulating water management in river systems. With morl4water, 
you can build detailed water simulations and train or test your multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) agents in these settings. 
This guide will walk you through the key features of the tool. Please refer to the relevant sections based on your needs.

## Simulation Approach
<!-- start simulation approach -->
The morl4water framework is built on the assumption that any river system to be simulated can be represented by a structured combination of nodes and flows. Each major component of the system—such as reservoirs, power plants, irrigation districts, etc.—is represented as a "node" with unique attributes and behaviors tailored to that element. These nodes are then interconnected by "flows," which direct water movement between nodes, enabling the construction of complex river architectures.

To showcase an example have a look at the picture below:
![Examplary river diagram with nodes and flows](docs/_static/_images/Nodes_and_flows.drawio.png)

It's important to note that multiple flows can converge at a single node, and multiple flows can also diverge from it. Additionally, there are different types of nodes and flows, each serving unique functions within the river system. The diagram below illustrates how all elements within a river system are classified.

![Diagram of river elements](docs/_static/_images/Elements_diagram.drawio.png)

All yellow boxes represent classes implemented within the morl4water framework. The `Facility` and `ControlledFacility` classes are always used as superclasses for other facility-related classes. Similarly, the `Flow` class serves as a superclass for both `Inflow` and `Outflow`, although instances of the `Flow` class itself are also frequently used. To clarify the purpose of each element:

Facility (classes over which RL agent has no control over):
1. **Catchment** - A region where rainfall is naturally gathered by the landscape, effectively adding water to the system and resulting in a net gain.
2. **Irrigation District** - An area where water is consumed and water demand is to be met.
3. **Power Plant** - Place where hydropwer is produced.

Controlled Facility (classes over which RL agent has control over):
1. **Reservoir** - stores water and releases it based on the RL action.
2. **Reservoir with Pump** - stores water and releases it based on the RL action. It can also pump water against its natural flow.
3. **Weir** - It can seperate river flow into 2 seperate flows with different flow rate based on the RL action. It does not store water.

Flow:
1. **Inflow** - Flow which introduces water to the system based on the data file of water flow rates.
2. **Flow** - Flow connecting two nodes (two river elements) allowing water to go through the system. 
3. **Outflow** - Flow which simply has no destination.

### Time in the Simulation

<!-- start simulation approach - Time-->
A clear understanding of how time is handled in the simulation is essential for grasping its mechanics. For each simulation, the user needs to set four key time-related parameters:

1. **start_date** - The date when the simulation should start.
2. **timestep_size** - Time between different RL Agent's actions usually a month.
3. **integration_timestep_size** - Time determining the shorter state updates within `timestep_size`.
4. **max_episode_steps** - Number of steps to end an episode. It tells how many `timestep_size` to perform before ending the simulation. 

The simulation is structured so that when an RL Agent takes an action, this action is applied consistently over the duration specified by `timestep_size`. During this period, each river element, such as facilities and flows, is updated at intervals defined by `integration_timestep_size` (typically spanning several hours) until the end of the current `timestep_size`. Afterward, the RL agent selects a new action based on the updated states of these elements.

Each river element is updated individually and sequentially within the `timestep_size`, ensuring that all elements are processed in a specific order. This approach means that, as the simulation enters a new `timestep_size`, an exemplary facility (node) is updated step-by-step at `integration_timestep_size` intervals until the end of this `timestep_size`. Only then a flow leaving from that facility can be subsequently updated.

<!-- end simulation approach - Time-->

## Code Structure
<!-- start code structure - intro -->
To successfully simulate an environment, morl4water package refers to multiple files and scripts which are dependent on each other. To have a clearer picture of how does a simulation work, this section goes through the code details and provide descriptions of the code logics. To better visualize the logics, the Nile river case and its file names will serve as an example.

In general there are three main scripts that provide the backbone of the simulation: **`nile_example.py`**, **`nile_river_simulation.py`**, **`water_management_system.py`**. They have different functions which can be summarised in the form of the table below:

![Scripts Table](docs/_static/_images/Scripts_Table.png)

The following sections will provide a detailed description of each script. Before diving in, however, the two summary diagrams below offer a quick overview of the top-level interactions between the scripts. Each block has an assigned function number, place where the function takes place and the description of the action. The first diagram illustrates the process for initializing the river environment:

![Initialisation Diagram](docs/_static/_images/Initialisation_diagram.drawio.png)

The next diagram provides a summary of how the RL Agent interacts with the environment and how the environemnt is updated after each action.

![Update Env Diagram](docs/_static/_images/Update_diagram.drawio.png)

Now with these short diagram summaries it should be easier to understand more details behind the main scripts described in the next sections.

<!-- end code structure - intro -->

### nile_example.py
<!-- start code structure - nile_example.py -->
This is the main simulation script with two crucial activities it is responsible for:

1. **Initialising the simulation environment** - Calling the environment with its ID to activate `nile_river_simulation.py`. 
2. **Connecting the RL Agent with the envrionment** - Providing current observation states to RL Agent and passing its actions to `.step()` method of the environment.

The first activity happens by creating `water_management_system` variable using the `mo_gymnasium` package as shown below:

```python
water_management_system = mo_gymnasium.make('nile-v0')
```
Where `nile-v0` refers to a default version of Nile environemnt as specified in `nile_river_simulation.py` file. The versions differ between each other only through the custom objectives. This setup aligns the **morl4water** environment with typical gym environments, ensuring that it behaves in a familiar way for those working with the gym framework.

The second activity happens in the `run_nile()` function. There, the environment is first reset using the `.reset()` method and then updated in a loop with actions provided by a Reinforcement Learning Agent or another source. The actions, stored in the `action` variable, are passed as an argument to the `.step()` method. With each iteration the observation states and rewards are recalculated and returned to the RL Agent which takes a new action based on this information. This loop continues until the simulation concludes or an environment constraint is violated. In the case of a violation, the variables `final_truncated` and `final_terminated` will trigger the loop to break.

As can be understood, `.step()` method is crucial since with every interation it returns a tuple of multiple important variables. Those include current states of the observation space (`final_observation`) and rewards (`final_reward `) for every action. What happens exactly within `.step()` can be examined in `water_management_system.py` script located in `morl4water/core/envs/`.

<!-- end code structure - nile_example.py -->


### nile_river_simulation.py
<!-- start code structure - nile_river_simulation.py -->
As mentioned before to start the whole simulation the environemnt must be first initialised. This initialisation refers to calling a function in **`nile_river_simulation.py`** which creates an instance of the gym environment class. In general the script actions can be summed up to:

1. **Creating simulation elements** - reservoirs etc. as instances of specific classes.
2. **Ordering simulation elements** - creating an ordered list to ensure that element updates align with the direction of water flow.
3. **Creating an environment** - as an instance of the gym environment class with all variables. 
  
Defining simulation elements involves creating instances of classes for each component of the river system, such as reservoirs, flows, irrigation districts, and others. This setup takes place within the `create_nile_river_env()` function, where all elements follow a similar structure, as shown in the example of a reservoir below:

```python
    GERD_reservoir = Reservoir(
        "GERD",
        max_capacity=117500000000.0,
        max_action=[10000],
        integration_timestep_size=relativedelta(minutes=240),
        objective_function=Objective.no_objective,
        stored_water=15000000000.0,
        evap_rates=np.loadtxt(data_directory / "reservoirs" / "evap_GERD.txt"),
        evap_rates_timestep_size=relativedelta(months=1),
        storage_to_minmax_rel=np.loadtxt(data_directory / "reservoirs" / "store_min_max_release_GERD.txt"),
        storage_to_level_rel=np.loadtxt(data_directory / "reservoirs" / "store_level_rel_GERD.txt"),
        storage_to_surface_rel=np.loadtxt(data_directory / "reservoirs" / "store_sur_rel_GERD.txt"),
    )
```
As shown, each river element's class may require a range of variables, and in some cases, external data files as well, depending on the specific requirements of that element. To better understand what variables and data files are needed for specific classes and what do they mean please refer to the inputs of specific classes in `morl4water/models`.

Once all river system elements have been assigned to a class it is possible to order them in `water_systems` entry when creating an instance of `WaterManagementSystem` class. This happens at the end of `create_nile_river_env()` function. 

The actual creation of the environment happens when it's registered version is called through `water_management_system = mo_gymnasium.make('nile-v0')` in `nile_example.py`. The name `nile-v0` refers to the registered version of the enviornment which can be seen at the beginning of `nile_river_simulation.py` in this way:

```python
register(
    id='nile-v0',
    entry_point='examples.nile_river_simulation:create_nile_river_env',
)
```
Now in this case, the instance created under `water_management_system` variable will be based on the gym environment's class defined in `water_management_system.py`.

<!-- end code structure - nile_river_simulation.py -->

### water_management_system.py
<!-- start code structure - water_management_system.py -->
The role of `water_management_system.py`can be quickly described as:
1. **Providing implementation of the environment class** - The class implementation includes all essential methods, covering the definition of observation, reward, and action spaces, as well as the core `.step()` method responsible for updating the whole environment state.


This script holds the class description of the whole environment. It determines how observation and action space are handled and returned to `nile_example.py`. A very important part of the whole class is the `step()` method. It is called in `nile_example.py` and leads to the whole process of updates for every system element in the river flow acccording to the order from `nile_river_simulation.py`. Those element updates are initated in a loop where all water elements in the simulation correspond to `water_systems` list as shown below:

```python
        for water_system in self.water_systems:
            water_system.current_date = self.current_date

            if isinstance(water_system, ControlledFacility):
                observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = water_system.step(action[water_system.name])

            elif isinstance(water_system, Facility) or isinstance(water_system, Flow):
                observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = water_system.step()
            else:
                raise ValueError()
```

The elements are organized into three main superclasses: `ControlledFacility`, `Facility` and `Flow`. All these types are updated through the `.step()` method of their respective superclass. Additionally, `ControlledFacility` elements receive an action input, as they are designed to be controlled by the agent.

At the end of each iteration, the `.step()` method in `water_management_system.py` returns a tuple of several variables to `nile_example.py`, including arrays of observations and rewards, after all elements have been updated. Each iteration corresponds to a time interval specified by `timestep_size` (usually one month). These outputs are then accessed by the RL Agent in `nile_example.py`, which uses the information to decide on its next action. This initiates another iteration, where the environment, stored in the `water_management_system` variable, undergoes an update via its `.step()` method. The loop continues in `nile_example.py` until the simulation completes or encounters errors.

As previously mentioned, each element in the environment activates its own `.step()` method during an update. To provide a clearer understanding of how this process works, the following sections will detail the state update mechanisms for different facilities (nodes) and flows.  

<!-- end code structure - water_management_system.py -->

## Updating Facilities
<!-- start updating facilities-->
In general, the river environment is updated with `.step()` as implemented in ``water_management_system.py``. Next, this method comes down to activating `.step()` of particular facilities either instances of `ControlledFacility` or `Facility` superclass. The full implementation of superclasses can be found in `morl4water/models/facility.py`. Nevertheless, for both of those, their `.step()` methods are very similar and structured in a similar way:

1. **Appending self.all_outflow list** - Appending list of outflow rates [m^3/s] based on the current action for this facility.
2. **Providing observation variable** - Providing the current state of the facility [Only ControlledFacility] 
2. **Determinig a potential reward** - Each facility may have an objective assigned to it in `nile_river_simulation.py`.
3. **Checking if terminated** - Check if a potential constraint has been violated to end an episode.
4. **Checking if truncated** - Check if an external condition (like time limit) should end an episode. 
5. **Checking info** - Providing useful information about a facility in an `info` variable.   

An examplary `.step()` method for `ControlledFacility` is presented below: 

```python
    def step(self, action: ActType) -> tuple[ObsType, SupportsFloat, bool, bool, dict]:
        self.all_outflow.append(self.determine_outflow(action))

        observation = self.determine_observation()
        reward = self.determine_reward()
        terminated = self.is_terminated()
        truncated = self.is_truncated()
        info = self.determine_info()

        self.timestep += 1

        return (
            observation,
            reward,
            terminated,
            truncated,
            info,
        )
```
Now all of those parts of `.step()` method are handled by additional methods. Please note that some of those are defined differently for each element of the river system. Thus, to exactly see what it is behind a method you may need to refer to specific classes like reservoir etc., these can be found in `morl4water/models`. However, a high-level overview is provided below:

1. **self.determine_outflow()** - This method is responsible for making the water flow through a river element. For instances of `Facility` superclass it is one of the `Facility` methods. For instances of `ControlledFacility` superclass, one should look for the implementation within the specific class. The next section will develop more on this method.

2. **self.determine_reward()** - This refers to the method implemented in a specific class where `self.objective_function()` takes an argument and returns the reward. The `self.objective_function` is assigned to an instance of the class at its creation in `nile_river_simulation.py` as one of standard functions from `morl4water/core/models/objective.py`.

3. **self.is_terminated()** - For instances of the `Facility` superclass, this method originates from the `Facility` class and returns `False` by default. In contrast, for instances of the `ControlledFacility` superclass, the method is defined within their specific class. For instance, in the case of reservoirs, the method will return `True` if the volume of stored water exceeds its physical limits.

4. **self.is_truncated()** - This method is implemented directly in `ControlledFacility` and `Facility` superclasses. In the current state of development it always returns `False`. 

5. **self.determine_info()** - This refers to the method implemented in a specific class. Based on the class it can return a dictionary with different information. 

<!-- end updating facilities-->

### Determining Facilities Outflows
<!-- start updating facilities - Determining Facilities Outflows intro -->
Determining outflows of system's elements in the river environment is a critical part of the `.step()` method in each superclass. The function `self.determine_outflow()` allows water to flow through river elements and updates their states. The implementation of this function varies between the two superclasses.
<!-- end updating facilities - Determining Facilities Outflows intro -->

#### `Facility` Outflows
<!-- start updating facilities - `Facility` Outflows -->
For `Facility` superclass, the method `self.determine_outflow()` is defined directly within itself:

```python
    def determine_outflow(self) -> float:
        return self.get_inflow(self.timestep) - self.determine_consumption()
```
Now `self.determine_consumption()` method comes from a specific element class and `self.get_inflow()` is a method of `Facility` superclass returning an inflow for a specific `self.timestep`. The `self.get_inflow()` is, in turn, defined as:

```python
    def get_inflow(self, timestep: int) -> float:
        return self.all_inflow[timestep]
```
The `self.all_inflow` list is a list of inflows which is updated by another method within `Facility` superclass called `set_inflow`:

```python
    def set_inflow(self, timestep: int, inflow: float) -> None:
        if len(self.all_inflow) == timestep:
            self.all_inflow.append(inflow)
        elif len(self.all_inflow) > timestep:
            self.all_inflow[timestep] += inflow
        else:
            raise IndexError
```
The use of `if` and `elif` statements is necessary due to the potential for multiple inflows converging on a single facility. Given the structure of `morl4water`, the `set_inflow` method is invoked during updates of `Flow` objects. This means that `Flow` objects must be called before instances of `Facility` in the river system (this comes from elements ordering in `nile_river_simulation.py`), ensuring that there is always a flow connecting a node to the rest of the system. These `Flow` objects serve as crucial components within the overall river system, linking various `Facility` and `ControlledFacility` objects. Specifically, the `set_inflow` method is called within the `Flow` superclass in the `set_destination_inflow()` method to append the inflow rates to the `self.all_inflow` list of its destination node.

<!-- end updating facilities - `Facility` Outflows -->

#### `ControlledFacility` Outflows
<!-- start updating facilities - `ControlledFacility` Outflows -->
For `ControlledFacility` superclass, the `self.determine_outflow()` works a bit differently. Mainly, the `self.determine_outflow()` actually receives an action based on which the facility state will change. Because of this and because this action can diffferently affect the instance of `ControlledFacility`, the `self.determine_outflow()` method itself is implemented within the specific class of the river element. Usually it is a reservoir where the full process of updating water within itself is calculated based on the RL Agent's action and water evaporation based on the reservoir's data. This whole process for a reservoir can be seen in `morl4water/models/reservoir.py`. 
<!-- end updating facilities - `ControlledFacility` Outflows -->

## Updating Flows
<!-- start updating flows-->
Instances of `Flow` superclass just as instances of facilites must be updated within each iteration of the main `.step()` method in `water_management_system.py`. Basically for objects of `Flows` the following `.step()` method applies:

```python
    def step(self) -> tuple[Optional[ObsType], float, bool, bool, dict]:

        self.set_destination_inflow()

        terminated = self.determine_source_outflow() > self.max_capacity
        truncated = self.is_truncated()
        reward = float("-inf") if terminated else 0.0 
        info = self.determine_info()

        self.timestep += 1

        return None, reward, terminated, truncated, info
```
The core function of the `.step()` method lies in the `.set_destination_inflow()` method. This function determines the flow's destinations and any associated distribution ratios, then calculates the appropriate inflow for each destination. It does so by assessing the total inflow to the flow object and applying the distribution ratios to allocate the correct inflow amount to each destination. This is presented here:

```python
    def set_destination_inflow(self) -> None:

        for destination_index, (destination, destination_inflow_ratio) in enumerate(self.destinations.items()):
            destination_inflow = self.determine_source_outflow_by_destination(
                destination_index, destination_inflow_ratio
            )

            destination.set_inflow(self.timestep, destination_inflow * (1.0 - self.evaporation_rate))
```
<!-- end updating flows-->

## Water Simulations
<!-- start implemented simulations -->
As for now there are three simulations implemented and ready to be run:

1. **Nile**
2. **Susquehanna**
3. **Omo**

They all differ in their structure, river elements, observation space, action space and objectives. Below you should be able to find detailed descriptions of these simulations.
<!-- end implemented simulations -->

### Nile
<!-- start implemented simulations -Nile -->
The Nile River is a critical resource in northeastern Africa, serving as a water source for hydropower, agriculture, and domestic use across multiple nations. Water rights issues, particularly between Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, have intensified with Ethiopia's construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), intended for hydropower generation to boost its economic development.

Originally, the simulation starts at **(2025, 1, 1)** and the decisions are taken on a monthly basis over a 20-year period, resulting in **240 time steps** for each episode. It also has 4 following objectives:

1. <span style="color:blue"> Ethiopia power (max), ref point: 0.0<span style="color:blue">
2. <span style="color:blue"> Sudan deficit (min), ref point: -240 <span style="color:blue">
3. <span style="color:blue"> Egypt deficit (min), ref point: -240 <span style="color:blue">
4. <span style="color:blue"> HAD minimum level (max), ref point 0.0 <span style="color:blue">

Where max/main signifies whether an objective is to be maximised or minimised. The reference point is used for calculating hypervolume as the worst case scenario in terms of acquired rewards by the agent at the end of the simulation.

Currently the user may pick their own number of objectives they want to use in their simulations with:

- 2 objectives: Ethiopia power (max) and Egypt deficit (min)
- 3 objectives: Ethiopia power (max), Egypt deficit (min), and Sudan deficit (min)
- 4 objectives: All original objectives

Where in all cases:
- Observation space: Storage in 4 reservoirs, month (5 dimensions)
- Action space: Release per each reservoir (4 dimensions)

Here you can see a picture visualising Nile river structure:

<!-- end implemented simulations -Nile -->

### Susquehanna
<!-- start implemented simulations -Susquehanna -->
The Susquehanna River, regulated by the Conowingo Dam, supports diverse needs, including hydroelectric power, water supply, and recreation. However, low-flow conditions create challenging trade-offs, forcing Conowingo to balance energy production with environmental and community water needs.

Originally, the simulation starts at **(2021, 1, 1)** and the decisions are made every 4 hours throughout a year resulting in **2190 time steps** per episode (the whole simulation). It also has 6 following objectives:


1. <span style="color:blue"> Recreation (max), ref point: 0.0<span style="color:blue">
2. <span style="color:blue"> Energy revenue (max), ref point: 0.0 <span style="color:blue">
3. <span style="color:blue"> Baltimore (max), ref point: 0.0  <span style="color:blue">
4. <span style="color:blue"> Atomic (max), ref point: 0.0 <span style="color:blue">
5. <span style="color:blue"> Chester (max), ref point: 0.0 <span style="color:blue">
6. <span style="color:blue"> Environment (min), ref point: -2190 <span style="color:blue">

Where max/main signifies whether an objective is to be maximised or minimised. The reference point is used for calculating hypervolume as the worst case scenario in terms of acquired rewards by the agent at the end of the simulation.

Currently the user may pick their own number of objectives they want to use in their simulations with:

  - 2 objectives: Baltimore (max) vs Chester (max)
  - 3 objectives: Baltimore (max), Atomic (max), Chester (max)
  - 4 objectives: Baltimore (max), Atomic (max), Chester (max), Recreation (max)
  - 5 objectives: Baltimore (max), Atomic (max), Chester (max), Recreation (max), revenue (max)
  - 6 objectives: Baltimore (max), Atomic (max), Chester (max), Recreation (max), revenue (max), environmental index (min)


Where in all cases:
- Observation space: Water level, month (2 dimensions)
- Action space: Release per each reservoir (4 dimensions)

Here you can see a picture visualising Omo river structure:

<!-- end implemented simulations -Susquehanna -->

### Omo
<!-- start implemented simulations -Omo -->
The Lower Omo-Gibe River Basin in Ethiopia highlights the complex challenges of balancing hydropower, irrigation, and environmental flow needs in a developing region. This model includes key infrastructure like the Gibe III and Koysha dams, the Kuraz sugar plantation irrigation schemes and Omorate town.

Originally, the simulation starts at **(2029, 1, 1)** and the decisions are taken on a monthly basis over a 12-year period, resulting in **144 time steps** for each episode (the whole simulation). It also has 3 following objectives:


1. <span style="color:blue"> Hydropower at Gibe-III and Koysha plants (max), ref point: 0.0 <span style="color:blue">
2. <span style="color:blue"> Kuraz plantation deficit (min), ref point: -144 <span style="color:blue">
3. <span style="color:blue"> Omorate town deficit (min), ref point: -144  <span style="color:blue">


Where max/min signifies whether an objective is to be maximised or minimised. The reference point is used for calculating hypervolume as the worst case scenario in terms of acquired rewards by the agent at the end of the simulation.

Currently the user may pick only one variation of objectives which is the default one with all 3 objectives:

  - 3 objectives: Hydropower (max), Kuraz plantation deficit (min), Omorate town deficit (min)



Where in all cases:
- Observation space: Gibe-III reservoir, Koysha reservoir,  month (3 dimensions)
- Action space: Gibe-III reservoir's release, Koysha reservoir's release, Weir(3 dimensions)

The Omo case is unique because, beyond managing reservoir releases, it also involves determining the percentage split of water flow at the weir. This weir does not store water; instead, it divides the flow into two separate streams—one directed toward the Kuraz plantations and the other to Omorate town.

## Running
<!-- start running a simulation -->
As mentioned in the section of "Implemented Simulations" there are currently 3 river systems which can be simulated with a different number of objectives.
<!-- end running a simulation -->

### Running Manually
<!-- start running a simulation - Manual -->
 If you want to run the simulation manually, navigate to one of the main scripts containing a line defining the environment like this:

```python

water_management_system = mo_gymnasium.make('nile-v0')

```
In case of Nile simulation it would be a script called `nile_example.py`. Based on the river simulation you plan to run and the number of objectives, ensure that you adjust the `water_management_system` variable accordingly: (For reference on what each objective corresponds to, consult the "Implemented Simulations" section.)

- **Nile:** ``mo_gymnasium.make('nile-v0')``
  - 2 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('nile2-v0')``
  - 3 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('nile3-v0')``
  - 4 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('nile-v0')``
- **Susquehanna:** ``mo_gymnasium.make('susquehanna-v0')``
  - 2 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('susquehanna2-v0')``
  - 3 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('susquehanna3-v0')``
  - 4 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('susquehanna4-v0')``
  - 5 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('susquehanna5-v0')``
  - 6 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('susquehanna-v0')``
- **Omo** ``mo_gymnasium.make('omo-v0')``
  - 3 objectives: ``mo_gymnasium.make('omo-v0')``

After this make sure the `action` variable is connected to your RL Agent since by default it samples random actions from the action space in the following manner:

```python

action = water_management_system.action_space.sample()

```
Now once you run the script, you should be able to run the simulation successfully.

### Running `launch_experiment.py`
<!-- start running a simulation - Launch -->
If your version of morl4water includes the `launch_experiment.py` script along with its supplementary files, you can start the simulation directly from the console using a single command. Below are examples of commands for running simulations across different river systems:

**Nile:**
```python
python launch_experiment.py --algo pcn --gamma 1.0 --env-id nile-v0 --num-timesteps 200000 --ref-point 0 -240 -240 0 --init-hyperparams learning_rate:0.0002 hidden_dim:128 "scaling_factor:np.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])" --wandb-entity [your_name] --seed 10
```

**Susquehanna:**
```python
python launch_experiment.py --algo pcn --env-id susquehanna-v0 --num-timesteps 200000 --gamma 1.0 --ref-point 0 0 0 0 0 -2190 --init-hyperparams learning_rate:0.0004 hidden_dim:128 "scaling_factor:np.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])" --wandb-entity [your_name] --seed 10
```
**Omo:**
```python
python launch_experiment.py --algo pcn --gamma 1.0 --env-id omo-v0 --num-timesteps 200000 --ref-point 0 -144 -144 --init-hyperparams learning_rate:0.0002 hidden_dim:128 "scaling_factor:np.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5])" --wandb-entity [your_name] --seed 10
```
Where:

- **algo:** Corresponds to the MORL algorithm one decides to use.
- **env-id:** Is the simulation with the number of objectives that was picked.
- **num-timesteps:** Is the number of timesteps for the simulation.
- **ref-point:** Is the reference point for calculating hypervolume of the solution set coming from Pareto front. Each objective must be given here the worst case of acquired rewards at the end of the episode.
- **init-hyperparams** learning_rate: Is the learning rate for the algorithm.
- **hidden_dim:** Is the hidden dimension for the network within the algorithm.
- **scaling_factor:** Is a numpy array of scaling factors which length is always bigger by one compared to the number of objectives.
- **wandb-entity:** Is the entity used for sending logs to weights and biases account.
- **seed:** Is the initial value used to start a pseudorandom number generator.

## Creating a Simulation
<!-- start creating a sim - needed files -->
To create a new river simulation from scratch within morl4watwer package, it is necessary to create two new scripts and add the required data files related to reservoirs and other potential facilities. The needed files are as follows: 

1. **`[project name]_example.py`**  
This is the main file where the environement is initialised and the `.step()` method for the environment is called and updated in a loop. It should be located as a seperate script in `morl4water` package.

2. **`[project name]_simulation.py`**  
This is where the river components (facilites like reservoirs, flows etc.) are defined as objects of classes and later installed in a list to form the whole river system for the simulation. The order ofcomponents is important and should follow the river flow. This file should be located in `morl4water/examples` directory.

3. **Data files (.txt)**  
The specific data files needed for creating a simulation depend on the number and type of facilities used in the river simulation. Please refer to explanations and the code of picked facilites to learn what data files are needed in your case. The data files should be located in `morl4water/examples/data/[project name]` directory. 

The precise explanations of the aforementioned scripts should be located in Structure section of this documentation. To illustrate how the list of all needed files could look like, the list of files for Nile river simulation is presented below.

### Nile Case
<!-- start creating sim - Nile case -->
Below one can see how the necessary scripts and data files were structured for the Nile river case. Only parts of the whole morl4water package containing the necessary scripts and files (green names) are presented.
- `morl4water/`: Root directory of the morl4water package.
    - **<span style="color: green;">`nile_example.py`</span>**: The main file where the environment is initialised.
    - `examples/`: Contains source code for the project.
      - **<span style="color: green;">`nile_river_simulation.py`</span>**: Defining river's components and ordering them with the river flow.
      - `data/`:
        - `nile_river/`:
          - `catchments/`: All data regarding water inflows to the river. To simplify only files related to Blue Nile inflow are shown here.
            - **<span style="color: green;">`InflowBlueNile.txt`</span>**: Data file with water flows of Blue Nile inflow.
          - `irrigation/`: All data regarding water demands for irrigation districts. To simplify only files related to Egypt district are shown here.
            - **<span style="color: green;">`irr_demand_Egypt.txt`</span>**: Data file with demands for Egypt district.
          - `reservoirs/`: All data regarding reservoirs. To simplify only files related to GERD reservoir are shown here.
            - **<span style="color: green;">`evap_GERD.txt`</span>**: Reservoir evaporation data.
            - **<span style="color: green;">`store_level_rel_GERD.txt`</span>**: Data relating reservoir's level(height) to reservoir's volume.
            - **<span style="color: green;">`store_min_max_release_GERD.txt`</span>**: Data relating max and min releases to reservoir's volume.
            - **<span style="color: green;">`store_sur_rel_GERD.txt`</span>**: Data relating reservoir's water surface to reservoir's volume.
