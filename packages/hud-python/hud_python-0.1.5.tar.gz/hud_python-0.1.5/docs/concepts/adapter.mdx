# Adapter

An `Adapter` in the HUD SDK is responsible for translating between your agent's action format and the Common Language for Action (CLA) format used by the HUD environment.

## Purpose

Adapters serve as a bridge between:

* Your agent's custom action format

* The standardized CLA format expected by HUD environments

This allows you to use different agent implementations without changing how they interact with the environment.

## Built-in Adapters

The HUD SDK includes several built-in adapters:

* **Claude Adapter**: For integrating with Anthropic's Claude models

* **Common Adapter**: A base adapter that can be extended for custom implementations

## Creating a Custom Adapter

You can create your own adapter by extending the base `Adapter` class:

```python
from hud.adapters.common import Adapter
from hud.adapters.common.types import ClickAction, Point, TypeAction

class SimpleAdapter(Adapter):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.agent_width = 1024
        self.agent_height = 768
        
    def convert(self, data: Any) -> Any:
        # Convert the action dict to CLA format
        action_type = data.get("action")
        
        if action_type == "type":
            return TypeAction(text=data.get("text", ""), enter_after=False)
            
        elif action_type == "left_click":
            coord = data.get("coordinate", [0, 0])
            return ClickAction(point=Point(x=coord[0], y=coord[1]), button="left")
            
        # Fall back to parent's implementation
        return super().convert(data)
```

## Using Adapters

Adapters are used when creating an environment:

```python
# Initialize the adapter
adapter = SimpleAdapter()

# Create environment with the adapter
env = await run.make(adapter=adapter, metadata={"agent_id": "simple-agent"})
```
