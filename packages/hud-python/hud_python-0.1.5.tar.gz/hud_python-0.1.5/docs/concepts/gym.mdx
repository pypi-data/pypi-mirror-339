A `Gym` in the HUD SDK represents a specific environment where tasks can be executed. It defines the operating system, available tools, and constraints for the agent.

## Initialization

Gyms are typically loaded from the HUD API:

```python
from hud import HUDClient

client = HUDClient(api_key="your-api-key")
gym = await client.load_gym(id="OSWorld-Ubuntu")
```

## Available Gyms

The HUD platform offers several gyms, including:

* **OSWorld-Ubuntu**: A Linux Ubuntu environment for general OS tasks

You can list all available gyms using:

```python
gyms = await client.list_gyms()
print(gyms)  # List of available gym IDs
```

## Gym Properties

Each gym has the following properties:

* `id`: Unique identifier for the gym

* `name`: Human-readable name of the gym

## Using Gyms

Gyms are used when creating a run:

```python
run = await client.create_run(name="my-run", gym=gym, evalset=evalset)
```

This associates the run with the specific environment defined by the gym.
