An `Env` in the HUD SDK represents a running instance of a gym where an agent can interact with tasks. It provides methods for observation, action, and evaluation.

## Initialization

Environments are created from a run:

```python
from hud import HUDClient

client = HUDClient(api_key="your-api-key")
gym = await client.load_gym(id="OSWorld-Ubuntu")
evalset = await client.load_evalset(id="OSWorld-Ubuntu")
run = await client.create_run(name="example-run", gym=gym, evalset=evalset)

# Create environment
env = await run.make(metadata={"agent_id": "example"})

# Wait for environment to be ready
while True:
    if await env.get_env_state() in ["running", "error"]:
        break
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
```

## Key Methods

The `Env` class provides several key methods:

### Reset

Resets the environment to a specific task:

```python
observation = await env.reset(task_id, metadata={"run": "example"})
```

### Step

Takes an action in the environment and returns the new state:

```python
observation, reward, terminated, info = await env.step(action)
```

### Evaluate

Evaluates the current task:

```python
result = await env.evaluate()
```

### Close

Closes the environment:

```python
await env.close()
```

## Observations

Observations from the environment include:

* `screenshot`: A base64-encoded PNG image of the current screen

* `text`: Text observation, if available

## Environment States

An environment can be in one of several states:

* `creating`: The environment is being created

* `running`: The environment is running and ready for interaction

* `error`: An error occurred during environment creation or execution

* `closed`: The environment has been closed

## VNC Access

For debugging purposes, you can view the environment directly via VNC:

```python
live_url = await env.get_vnc_url()
client.display_stream(live_url)
```
