# Deinterlace Resonant-Scanned Images
This python module can be used to correct the misalignment between forward and backward-scanned lines using a Fourier-based phase correlation approach.

## Features
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optional CuPy backend for increased performance
- **Batch Processing**: Supports block-wise processing to reduce memory constraints.
- **Subsampling for Noisy Data**: Deinterlacing can be applies to pixel-wise standard deviations for improved performance on noisy or sparse images.
- **Handles Instability**: Supports processing individual frames while autocorrection 
  methods applied during acquisition stabilize

## Dependencies
- Boltons
- CuPy  (Optional)
- NumPy
- TQDM
