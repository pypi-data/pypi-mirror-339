# SerialNumberTags

InvenTree plugin to enforce unique serial numbers based on part tags

## Description

By default, InvenTree allows only basic validation of serial number uniqueness, supporting validation of either:

- Across a "tree" of parts and variants
- Across all parts

This plugin provides serial number uniqueness to be validated across a specific set of parts, as controlled by a custom part parameter.

A set of "tags" applied to each part (as specified by the selected parameter) controls which parts are linked together.

## Installation

### Command Line 

To install manually via the command line, run the following command:

```bash
pip install inventree-serial-number-tags
```
