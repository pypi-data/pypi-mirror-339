# A Model Context Protocol Server for the British Science Museum Data API

This project is a Python MCP (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that allows your LLM to fetch data
from the British Science Museum. Info is available at https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collectionsonline/wiki/Collections-Online-API#get-search.

# Developing

This section is for anyone who wants to contribute to the codebase.

## Setup and Install Dependencies

Clone the repository.

The project is configured to use uv (Install link: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) for dependency management 
and building.
It uses npx (Install link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to run the MCP inspector.  

Create a virtual env with

```shell
uv venv
```

And install dependencies with

```shell
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

Run the inspector with
```shell
./inspector.sh
```
The inspector should output the localhost URL for accessing its UI.
## Running Unit Tests

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```
