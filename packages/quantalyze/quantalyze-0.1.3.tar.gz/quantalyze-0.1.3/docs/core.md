# Core

The **Core** module of the Quantalyze package provides essential utilities for scientific data analysis. These utilities include functions for fitting, symmetrization, smoothing, differentiation, and Fourier transforms. 

All of the more specific modules, such as `transport`, derive much of their functionality from this foundational module. By leveraging the robust tools provided here, these specialized modules build upon the core capabilities to address domain-specific requirements.
