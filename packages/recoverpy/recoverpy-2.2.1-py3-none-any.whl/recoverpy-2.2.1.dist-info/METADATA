# RecoverPy

RecoverPy is a powerful tool that leverages your system capabilities to recover lost files.

Unlike others, you can not only recover deleted files but also **overwritten** data.

Every block of your partition will be scanned. You can even find a string in binary files.

## Demo

</p>

## Setup

:penguin: RecoverPy is currently only available on Linux systems.  
:red_circle: **You must be root or use sudo**.

### Dependencies

**Mandatory:** To list and search through your partitions, recoverpy uses `grep`, `dd`, and `lsblk` commands. Although,
if you're running a major Linux distrucition these tools should already be installed.

**Optional:** To display real time grep progress, you can install `progress`.

To install all dependencies:

- Debian-like: `apt install grep coreutils util-linux progress`
- Arch: `pacman -S grep coreutils util-linux progress`
- Fedora: `dnf install grep coreutils util-linux progress`

## Usage

### Run with uvx

`sudo uvx recoverpy`

### Run with pipx

`sudo pipx run recoverpy`

### Installation from pip

`python3 -m pip install recoverpy`

then run `sudo python3 -m recoverpy`

---

- **Select the system partition** in which your file was. If you are out of luck, you can alternatively search in your
  home partition, maybe your IDE, text editor, etc. made a backup at some point.

- **Type a text string to search**. See tips below for better results.

- **Start search**, Results will appear in the left-hand box.

- **Select a result**.

- Once you have found your precious, **select `Open`**.

- You can now either save this block individually or explore neighboring blocks for the remaining parts of the file. You
  could then save it all in one file.

## Tips

- Always do backups! Yes, maybe too late...
- **Unmount your partition before you do anything!** Although you can search with your partition still mounted, it is
  highly recommended to unmount your partition to avoid any alteration to your file.

Regarding the searched string:

- Be concise, find something that could be unique to your file.
- Stay simple, your string is escaped but exotic characters may affect your results.
- Try to remember the last edit you have made to your file.

When you have found your file:

- You might see multiple results. Your system often use different partion blocks to save successive versions of a file.
  Make sure you've found the last version.
- Try exploring neighboring blocks to be sure to save your whole file.
