## Installation

```bash
pipx install kge-kubectl-get-events
```

## Usage

### View Events for All Pods

View events for all pods in the current namespace:

```bash
kge -A
# or
kge --all
```

### View Events for a Specific Pod

View events for a specific pod:

```bash
kge <pod-name>
```

### View Non-Normal Events

View only non-normal events (warnings and errors) for all pods:

```bash
kge --non-normal
# or
kge -n
```

In interactive mode, you can select "All pods with non-normal events" from the menu.

### Interactive Mode

Run the tool without arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
kge
```

This will display a menu of all pods in the current namespace, allowing you to select which pod's events to view. The menu includes an option to view all non-normal events.

### Shell Completion

The tool supports shell completion for pod names. To enable it:

#### For zsh

Add the following to your shell configuration:

```bash
source <(kge --completion=zsh)
```

Alternatively, add the completion script directly to your zsh configuration:

```bash
compdef _kge kge
_kge() {
    local -a pods
    pods=($(kge --complete))
    _describe 'pods' pods
}
```
