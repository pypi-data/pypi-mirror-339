class ModuleInterface:
    """The base class from which all custom ModuleInterface classes should inherit.

    Inheriting from this class grants all subclasses the static API that the MicroControllerInterface class uses to
    interface with specific module interfaces. It is essential that all abstract methods defined in this class are
    implemented for each custom module interface implementation that subclasses this class.

    Notes:
        Similar to the ataraxis-micro-controller (AXMC) library, the interface class has to be implemented separately
        for each custom module. The (base) class exposes the static API used by the MicroControllerInterface class to
        integrate each custom interface implementation with the general communication runtime cycle. To make this
        integration possible, this class defines some abstract (pure virtual) methods that developers have to implement
        for their interfaces. Follow the implementation guidelines in the docstrings of each abstract method and check
        the examples for further guidelines on how to implement each abstract method.

        When inheriting from this class, remember to call the parent's init method in the child class init method by
        using 'super().__init__()'! If this is not done, the MicroControllerInterface class will likely not be able to
        properly interact with your custom interface class!

        All data received from or sent to the microcontroller is automatically logged as byte-serialized numpy arrays.
        If you do not need any additional processing steps, such as sending or receiving data over MQTT, do not enable
        any custom processing flags when initializing this superclass!

        In addition to interfacing with the module, the class also contains methods to parse logged module data. It is
        expected that these modules will be used immediately after runtime to parse raw logged data and transform it
        into the desired format for further processing and analysis.

        Some attributes of this class are assigned by the managing MicroControllerInterface class at its
        initialization. Therefore, to be fully functional, each ModuleInterface class has to be bound to an initialized
        MicroControllerInterface instance.

    Args:
        module_type: The id-code that describes the broad type (family) of custom hardware modules managed by this
            interface class. This value has to match the code used by the custom module implementation on the
            microcontroller. Valid byte-codes range from 1 to 255.
        module_id: The code that identifies the specific custom hardware module instance managed by the interface class
            instance. This is used to identify unique modules in a broader module family, such as different rotary
            encoders if more than one is used at the same time. Valid byte-codes range from 1 to 255.
        mqtt_communication: Determines whether this interface needs to communicate with MQTT. If your implementation of
            the process_received_data() method requires sending data to MQTT via MQTTCommunication, set this flag to
            True when implementing the class. Similarly, if your interface is configured to receive commands from
            MQTT, set this flag to True.
        error_codes: A set that stores the numpy uint8 (byte) codes used by the interface module to communicate runtime
            errors. This set will be used during runtime to identify and raise error messages in response to
            managed module sending error State and Data messages to the PC. Note, status codes 0 through 50 are reserved
            for internal library use and should NOT be used as part of this set or custom hardware module class design.
            If the class does not produce runtime errors, set to None.
        data_codes: A set that stores the numpy uint8 (byte) codes used by the interface module to communicate states
            and data that needs additional processing. All incoming messages from the module are automatically logged to
            disk during communication runtime. Messages with event-codes from this set would also be passed to the
            process_received_data() method for additional processing. If the class does not require additional
            processing for any incoming data, set to None.
        mqtt_command_topics: A set of MQTT topics used by other MQTT clients to send commands to the module accessible
            through this interface instance. If the interface does not receive commands from mqtt, set this to None. The
            MicroControllerInterface set will use the set to initialize the MQTTCommunication class instance to
            monitor the requested topics and will use the use parse_mqtt_command() method to convert MQTT messages to
            module-addressed command structures.

    Attributes:
        _module_type: Stores the type (family) of the interfaced module.
        _module_id: Stores the specific module instance ID within the broader type (family).
        _type_id: Stores the type and id combined into a single uint16 value. This value should be unique for all
            possible type-id pairs and is used to ensure that each used module instance has a unique ID-type
            combination.
        _data_codes: Stores all event-codes that require additional processing.
        _mqtt_command_topics: Stores MQTT topics to monitor for incoming commands.
        _error_codes: Stores all expected error-codes as a set.
        _mqtt_communication: Determines whether this interface needs to communicate with MQTT.
        _log_directory: Stores the path to the directory where the MicroControllerInterface that manages this class logs
            all received and transmitted messages related to this interface. The value for this attribute is assigned
            automatically by the managing MicroControllerInterface class during its initialization.
        _microcontroller_id: Stores the unique ID byte-code of the microcontroller that controls the hardware module
            interfaced by this class instance. The value for this attribute is assigned automatically by the managing
            MicroControllerInterface class during its initialization.
        _input_queue: Stores the multiprocessing queue that enables sending the data to the microcontroller
            via the managing MicroControllerInterface class. Putting messages into this queue is equivalent to
            submitting them to the send_data() method exposed by the managing MicroControllerInterface class. The value
            for this attribute is assigned automatically by the managing MicroControllerInterface class during its
            initialization.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If input arguments are not of the expected type.

class MicroControllerInterface:
    """Interfaces with an Arduino or Teensy microcontroller running ataraxis-micro-controller library.

    This class contains the logic that sets up a remote daemon process with SerialCommunication, MQTTCommunication,
    and DataLogger bindings to facilitate bidirectional communication and data logging between the microcontroller and
    concurrently active local (same PC) and remote (network) processes. Additionally, it exposes methods that send
    runtime parameters and commands to the Kernel and Module classes running on the connected microcontroller.

    Notes:
        An instance of this class has to be instantiated for each microcontroller active at the same time. The
        communication will not be started until the start() method of the class instance is called.

        This class uses SharedMemoryArray to control the runtime of the remote process, which makes it impossible to
        have more than one instance of this class with the same controller_id at a time.

        Initializing MicroControllerInterface also completes the configuration of all ModuleInterface instances passed
        to the class constructor. It is essential to initialize both the interfaces and the MicroControllerInterface
        to have access to the full range of functionality provided by each ModuleInterface class.

    Args:
        controller_id: The unique identifier code of the managed microcontroller. This information is hardcoded via the
            ataraxis-micro-controller (AXMC) library running on the microcontroller, and this class ensures that the
            code used by the connected microcontroller matches this argument when the connection is established.
            Critically, this code is also used as the source_id for the data sent from this class to the DataLogger.
            Therefore, it is important for this code to be unique across ALL concurrently active Ataraxis data
            producers, such as: microcontrollers and video systems. Valid codes are values between 1 and 255.
        microcontroller_serial_buffer_size: The size, in bytes, of the microcontroller's serial interface (UART or USB)
            buffer. This size is used to calculate the maximum size of transmitted and received message payloads. This
            information is usually available from the microcontroller's vendor.
        microcontroller_usb_port: The serial USB port to which the microcontroller is connected. This information is
            used to set up the bidirectional serial communication with the controller. You can use
            list_available_ports() function from ataraxis-transport-layer-pc library to discover addressable USB ports
            to pass to this argument. The function is also accessible through the CLI command: 'axtl-ports'.
        data_logger: An initialized DataLogger instance used to log the data produced by this Interface
            instance. The DataLogger itself is NOT managed by this instance and will need to be activated separately.
            This instance only extracts the necessary information to pipe the data to the logger.
        module_interfaces: A tuple of classes that inherit from the ModuleInterface class that interface with specific
            hardware module instances managed by the connected microcontroller.
        baudrate: The baudrate at which the serial communication should be established. This argument is ignored
            for microcontrollers that use the USB communication protocol, such as most Teensy boards. The correct
            baudrate for microcontrollers using the UART communication protocol depends on the clock speed of the
            microcontroller's CPU and the supported UART revision. Setting this to an unsupported value for
            microcontrollers that use UART will result in communication errors.
        mqtt_broker_ip: The ip address of the MQTT broker used for MQTT communication. Typically, this would be a
            'virtual' ip-address of the locally running MQTT broker, but the class can carry out cross-machine
            communication if necessary. MQTT communication will only be initialized if any of the input modules
            requires this functionality.
        mqtt_broker_port: The TCP port of the MQTT broker used for MQTT communication. This is used in conjunction
            with the mqtt_broker_ip argument to connect to the MQTT broker.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If any of the input arguments are not of the expected type.

        _logger_queue: Stores the Multiprocessing Queue object used to pipe log data to the DataLogger cores.
        _log_directory: Stores the output directory used by the DataLogger to save temporary log entries and the final
            compressed .npz log archive.

            objects.
        _input_queue: Stores the multiprocessing Queue used to pipe the data to be sent to the microcontroller to
            the remote communication process.

            communication process.
        _communication_process: Stores the (remote) Process instance that runs the communication cycle.
        _watchdog_thread: A thread used to monitor the runtime status of the remote communication process.
        _reset_command: Stores the pre-packaged Kernel-addressed command that resets the microcontroller's hardware
            and software.
        _disable_locks: Stores the pre-packaged Kernel parameters configuration that disables all pin locks. This
            allows writing to all microcontroller pins.
        _enable_locks: Stores the pre-packaged Kernel parameters configuration that enables all pin locks. This
            prevents every Module managed by the Kernel from writing to any of the microcontroller pins.
        _started: Tracks whether the communication process has been started. This is used to prevent calling
            the start() and stop() methods multiple times.
        _start_mqtt_client: Determines whether to connect to MQTT broker during the main runtime cycle.

            During initialization, the MicroControllerInterface provides each managed ModuleInterface with the reference
            to the input_queue object. Each ModuleInterface can use its own _input_queue attribute to send the data
            to the communication process, eliminating the need for the data to go through this method. If you are
            developing a custom interface, you have the option for using either queue interface for submitting data to
            be sent to the microcontroller.

            terminator_array: The shared memory array used to control the communication process runtime.
            usb_port: The serial port to which the target microcontroller is connected.
            baudrate: The communication baudrate to use. This option is ignored for controllers that use USB interface,
                 but is essential for controllers that use the UART interface.
            microcontroller_buffer_size: The size of the microcontroller's serial buffer. This is used to determine

    """Extracts the data for the requested hardware module instances running on an Ataraxis Micro Controller (AMC)
    device from the .npz log file generated by a DataLogger instance during runtime.

    This function reads the '.npz' archive generated by the DataLogger 'compress_logs' method for requested
    ModuleInterface and MicroControllerInterface combinations and extracts all custom event-codes and data objects
    transmitted by the target hardware module instances from the microcontroller to the PC. At this time, the extraction
    specifically looks for the data sent by the hardware modules to the PC but, in the future, it may be updated to also
    parse the data sent by the PC to the hardware modules.

    This function is process- and thread-safe and can be pickled. It is specifically designed to be executed in-parallel
    for many concurrently used ModuleInterface and MicroControllerInterface instances, but it can also be used to work
    with a single hardware module's data. If you have an initialized ModuleInterface instance, it is recommended to use
    its 'extract_logged_data' method instead, as it automatically resolves the log_path argument and the module type
    and ID codes.

    Notes:
        The extracted data will NOT contain library-reserved events and messages. This includes all Kernel messages
        and module messages with event codes 0 through 50. The only exceptions to this rule are messages with event
        code 2, which report completion of commands. These messages are parsed in addition to custom messages
        sent by each hardware module.

        This function should be used as a convenience abstraction for the inner workings of the DataLogger class.
        For each ModuleInterface, it will decode and return the logged runtime data sent to the PC by the specific
        hardware module instance controlled by the interface. You need to manually implement further data
        processing steps as necessary for your specific use case and module implementation.

        The function assumes that it is given an .npz archive generated for a MicroControllerInterface instance and WILL
        behave unexpectedly if it is instead given an archive generated by another Ataraxis class, such as
        VideoSystem. Also, it expects that the archive contains the data for the target hardware module, identified by
        its type and instance ID codes. The function may behave unexpectedly if the archive does not contain the data
        for the module.

    Args:
        log_path: The path to the .npz archive file that stores the logged data generated by the
            MicroControllerInterface and all NModuleInterfaces managed by that microcontroller interface instance during
            runtime.
        module_type_id: A tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple stores the type and ID codes of a specific hardware
            module, whose data should be extracted from the archive (if it is present in the archive). This allows
            extracting data for multiple modules at the same time, optimizing the typically rate-limiting I/O operation.

    Returns:
        A tuple of ExtractedModuleData instances. Each instance stores all data extracted from the log archive for one
        specific hardware module instance.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input path is not valid or does not point to an existing .npz archive. If the function is
            unable to properly extract a logged data object for the target hardware module.
