class SerialCommunication:
    """Wraps a TransportLayer class instance and exposes methods that allow communicating with a microcontroller
    running ataraxis-micro-controller library using the USB or UART protocol.

    This class is built on top of the TransportLayer, designed to provide the microcontroller communication
    interface (API) for other Ataraxis libraries. This class is not designed to be instantiated directly and
    should instead be used through the MicroControllerInterface class available through this library!

    Notes:
        This class is explicitly designed to use the same parameters as the Communication class used by the
        microcontroller. Do not modify this class unless you know what you are doing.

        Due to the use of many non-pickleable classes, this class cannot be piped to a remote process and has to be
        initialized by the remote process directly.

        This class is designed to integrate with DataLogger class available from the ataraxis_data_structures library.
        The DataLogger is used to write all incoming and outgoing messages to disk as serialized message payloads.

    Args:
        source_id: The ID code to identify the source of the logged messages. This is used by the DataLogger to
            distinguish between log sources (classes that sent data to be logged) and, therefore, has to be unique for
            all Ataraxis classes that use DataLogger and are active at the same time.
        microcontroller_serial_buffer_size: The size, in bytes, of the buffer used by the target microcontroller's
            Serial buffer. Usually, this information is available from the microcontroller's manufacturer
            (UART / USB controller specification).
        usb_port: The name of the USB port to use for communication to, e.g.: 'COM3' or '/dev/ttyUSB0'. This has to be
            the port to which the target microcontroller is connected. Use the list_available_ports() function available
            from this library to get the list of discoverable serial port names.
        logger_queue: The multiprocessing Queue object exposed by the DataLogger class (via 'input_queue' property).
            This queue is used to buffer and pipe data to be logged to the logger cores.
        baudrate: The baudrate to use for the communication over the UART protocol. Should match the value used by
            the microcontrollers that only support UART protocol. This is ignored for microcontrollers that use the
            USB protocol.
        test_mode: This parameter is only used during testing. When True, it initializes the underlying TransportLayer
            class in the test configuration. Make sure this is set to False during production runtime.

        _transport_layer: The TransportLayer instance that handles the communication.
