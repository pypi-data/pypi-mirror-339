OpenVariant is a comprehensive Python package that provides different functionalities to read, parse and operate
different multiple input file formats (e. g. ``tsv``, ``csv``, ``vcf``, ``maf``, ``bed``), being able to customize the output.

Its aim is being able to manage a ton of data represented in multiple ways and be able to build an unified output with 
a proper annotation file structure. This package was thought to work with any kind of data that can be represented 
as a table.

_Documentation_: [https://openvariant.readthedocs.io](https://openvariant.readthedocs.io)

## Features

OpenVariant offers a toolkit to transform and operate the parsed input data. We will be able to apply different 
functionalities on our parsed result some of them are the following ones:

- Find files
- Read and save
- Cat
- Group by
- Count
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Plugins

Check [User guide](https://openvariant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html) in OpenVariant's documentation to find all the information about how it works 
and how can be applied the different functionalities.  

## Installation

It requires Python 3 or higher and can be installed as [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/open-variant/) with:

```bash
pip install open-variant
```

For more details check our [Installation](https://openvariant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) section.

## Examples

We provide a variety of [examples](https://github.com/bbglab/openvariant/tree/master/examples) to help to understand how OpenVariant can be applied. Explore the 
[Examples](https://openvariant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) section in OpenVariant's documentation for more details.

As well, we present a small dataset for hands-on use with OpenVariant, allowing users to test the tool's functionalities. It may be found at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14215914) and it can be downloaded using the following commands:
```bash
pip install zenodo_get                      
zenodo_get 14215914
```
