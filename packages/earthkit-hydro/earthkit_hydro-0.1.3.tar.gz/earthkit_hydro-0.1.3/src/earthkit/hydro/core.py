    Parameters
    ----------
    river_network : earthkit.hydro.RiverNetwork
        An earthkit-hydro river network object.
    field : ndarray
        The field data to be modified in place.
    invert_graph : bool
        If True, process the river network from sinks to sources.
        If False, process from sources to sinks.
    operation : callable
        The operation to apply to the field. This function should
        take four arguments: river_network, field, grouping, and mv.
    *args, **kwargs : additional arguments
        Additional arguments to pass to the operation function.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The modified field after applying the operation along the river network.
