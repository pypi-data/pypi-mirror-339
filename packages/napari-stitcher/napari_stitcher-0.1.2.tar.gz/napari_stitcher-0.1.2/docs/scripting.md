# Scripting and batch processing

The stitching functionality of `napari-stitcher` relies on the [`multiview-stitcher`](https://github.com/multiview-stitcher/multiview-stitcher) toolbox, which is a Python package to be used in scripts and batch processing. This allows you to automate the stitching process and integrate it into your existing workflows.

## Getting started

Have a look at:

1. The [multiview-stitcher documentation](https://multiview-stitcher.github.io/multiview-stitcher) for an overview of the toolbox and its functionality.
- A [code example](https://multiview-stitcher.github.io/multiview-stitcher/main/code_example/).
- Example [jupyter notebooks](https://multiview-stitcher.github.io/multiview-stitcher/main/notebooks/).
