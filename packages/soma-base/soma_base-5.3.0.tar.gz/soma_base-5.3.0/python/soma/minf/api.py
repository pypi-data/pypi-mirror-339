This module contains all the framework necessary to customize, read and
write minf files. A minf file is composed of structured data saved in
XML or Python format. The minf framework provides tools to read and write
minf files but also to customize the way Python objects are read an written.

There are several submodules in this package but main functions and classes
can be imported from :py:mod:`soma.minf.api`:

- for reading minf files: :func:`iterateMinf`, :func:`readMinf`
- for writing minf files: :func:`createMinfWriter`, :func:`writeMinf`
- for customizing minf files: :func:`createReducerAndExpander`, :func:`registerClass`, :func:`registerClassAs`

def minfFormat(source):
    '''
    Return a pair (format, reduction) identifying the minf format. If
    source is not a minf file, (None, None) is returned. Otherwise,
    format is a string representing the format of the minf file: 'XML' or
    'python'. reduction is the name of the reducer used to write the minf
    file or None if format is 'python'.

    Example:

    ::

      from soma.minf.api import minfFormat
      format, reduction = minfFormat('/home/me/test.minf')

    If source is a :class:`BufferAndFile` instance, this call behave as if nothing
    has been read from the file. This can be useful if you have an opened file
    that cannot be seeked backward:

    Example:

    ::

      from soma.bufferandfile import BufferAndFile
      from soma.minf.api import minfFormat, readMinf

      bf = BufferAndFile(stream_file_object)
