## What is MoSARt?

The Morphology from SAR toolbox (MoSARt) is a set of python scripts to retrieve morphology changes from SAR amplitude images.

![mosart_flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed2ccd72-6176-478b-b659-7ab75046195d)


The user needs to provide a set of coregistered amplitude images and a Digital Elevation Model in radar coordinates,
the user can also provide longitude and latitude datasets to georeference the results.

## Standard Installation (without coregistration workflow)

We recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda to create an environment in which to install MoSARt to prevent dependency conflicts.

```console
conda create --n mosart
pip install mosart
```

## Full Installation

MoSARt provides functions to coregister images from ALOS-1 and Sentinel-1 images (bursts). To run these functions the user needs
to install [hyp3-isce2](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-isce2).

```console
git clone https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-isce2.git
cd hyp3-isce2
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate hyp3-isce2
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Obtain elevation changes:

This repository contains a [notebook](Process_ALOS.ipynb) to illustrate the full workflow from MoSARt to retrieve elevation changes for the 2008 Okmok caldera eruption.

# Publication:

MoSARt was used to retrieve the elevation changes in the 2019-2020 Shishaldin eruption:
