This repository acts as an interface to abstract SPARQL queries to callable methods to interact with a running GraphDB instance in an easier way.

# Installation

pip install graph-db-interface
```

Or after cloning this repository you can also use poetry to install the package:

# Getting Started
The package uses a single class named `GraphDB`. To use the interface, simply generate an object from this class:

```python
from graph_db_interface import GraphDB

myDB = GraphDB(
    base_url=<your_graph_db_url>,
    username=<your_graph_db_user>
    password=<your_graph_db_password>
    repository=<your_selected_repository_id>
)
```
