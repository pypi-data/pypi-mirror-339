The `get` method
================
Most of the objects defined in LightWin have a *magic* `get` method.
It is a very convenient way to get the data you are interested in without having to type a very cumbersome path.

.. todo::
   A Jupyter Notebook would be better to show with examples.

.. todo::
   Dynamic list of variables than can be `get` from every object.
   The smart way would also involve type hints.
   Would be a significant refactor I think.
