        Non-activated interests disallow most operations to be carried out
        on them. Usually, only the operations needed to prepare the interest
        for activation will be allowed.

        Activation requires an interest be configured with a miminal set of
        requirements. The requirements may vary between the interest classes,
        but the following are the most common:

          - All interests other than 'platform' need to be linked to a parent
            before activation.
          - All interests require there be atleast one user with the apex role.
            This user can be inherited as well, so linking it to a parent is
            generally enough as long as role inheritence is enabled.
          - Only interests in the NEW or ACTIVE states can be activated using
            this interface. An alternate interface should be implemented to
            manage the other states.

        Additional controls determine which users are to be included in

        to a user because (generally) they hold a superior role. Inherited
        memberships are roles granted to a user because they hold the same
        membership in some parent Interest.

        Note that effective interests (role delegations) are only applied
        horizontally within an interest, while inherited memberships are
        only applied veritically across the interest hierarchy. Note that
        inherited memberships are often likely also effective memberships,
        though the response here will not reflect that since the delegation
        happens at the parent interest, where the user's original access
        level is granted.

        Typcically, by disabling both types of secondary users, you would
        retrieve the members defined local to the interest. By enabling
        both, you would get the list of users with access to the interest.
        Enabling only one or the other is not likely to provide meaningful
