An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides access to a dataset of Q-Anon posts for anthropological/sociological research. This server allows AI assistants like Claude to search, filter, and analyze the Q-Anon drops.

Posts are drawn from https://github.com/jkingsman/JSON-QAnon. You can learn more about how the source data was composed there, as well as find alternate formats, schemas, etc.
