% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to extract a JSON from the output of a LLM. This LLM split a prompt into a sub_prompt and modified_prompt. 

% Here is the generated llm_output: ```{llm_output}```

% Output a JSON object with the following keys:
    - 'explaination': String containing the explaination of the split and how the prompts should be extracted properly so that both prompts are complete and functional. For instance, sometimes there will be messages like '[... other internal module examples ...]' which means text is missing and should be copied the input prompt.
    - 'sub_prompt': String containing the sub_prompt that was split from the input_prompt.
    - 'modified_prompt': String containing the complete modified prompt from input_prompt split from the sub_prompt. Sometimes only the changed portion of the modified prompt is given so you may need to combine it with parts of the input prompt get the complete modified prompt.
