Blabel is a Python package to generate labels (typically for printing stickers)
with barcodes and other niceties.

**Some features:**

- Generates PDF files where each page is a label (that's the way most label printers want it).
- Label layout is defined by HTML (Jinja) templates and CSS. Supports any page dimensions and margins.
- Builtin support for various barcodes, QR-codes, datamatrix, and more (wraps other libraries).
- Labels data can be provided as list of dicts (easy to generate from spreadsheets).
- Possibility to print several items per sticker.
