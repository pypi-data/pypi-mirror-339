# ExceptHook

#### Description
This replaces the exception hook with one with a nice traceback and LLM integration for fixing errors

##### Usage
In any module that you are working in, when you run the module and an exception is triggered, the custom exception handler will be triggered. By default when the handler is triggered, the default traceback is printed but with a little enhancement using the `rich` library.

##### Options
If anywhere in your code there are any of these options trigger different behaviours.
- `#: fix`
- `#: enhance`

##### Fix
This will contact `Groq` LLM to fix the exception code.

##### Enhance
This will enhance the traceback in a well structured way

#### Environment
Create a virtual environment and activate it

#### Method 1
- Build the package locally and install using this command `pip install .`

#### Method 2
- Install from PyPi using this command `pip install excepthook`.

#### Setup 
- Create a `.env` file with your `GROQ_API_KEY`
- Run `install_hook` to write the `sitecustomize.py` in the `sitepackages` directory which will be providing the features.

Note: Must be in an environment.
