A modern, easy to use, Python â‰¥3.8 library for interacting with OBDII devices.

## Installing

Python 3.8 or higher is required.

A [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended to install the library.

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install py-obdii
```

### Install the development version

```bash
# From Github
pip install git+https://github.com/PaulMarisOUMary/OBDII@main[dev,test]

# From local source
git clone https://github.com/PaulMarisOUMary/OBDII
cd OBDII
pip install .[dev,test]

# From test.pypi.org
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ py-obdii
```

## Usage Example

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library is still in the design phase and may change in the future.

```python
from obdii import at_commands, commands, Connection

conn = Connection("COM5")

version = conn.query(at_commands.VERSION_ID)
print(f"Version: {version.value}")

response = conn.query(commands.VEHICLE_SPEED)
print(f"Vehicle Speed: {response.value} {response.units}")

conn.close()
```

## Using the Library Without a Physical Device

To streamline the development process, you can use the [ELM327-Emulator](https://pypi.org/project/ELM327-emulator) library. This allows you to simulate an OBDII connection without needing a physical device. 

### Setting Up the ELM327-Emulator

1. **Install the library with "dev" extra options**:
    ```bash
    pip install py-obdii[dev]
    ```

2. **Start the ELM327-Emulator**:
    ```bash
    python -m elm -p "REPLACE_WITH_PORT" -s car --baudrate 38400
    ```
> [!NOTE]
> Replace `REPLACE_WITH_PORT` with the serial port of your choice

### Use Virtual Ports on Windows

For Windows users, you can use [com0com](https://com0com.sourceforge.net) to create virtual serial ports and connect the ELM327-Emulator to your Python code.

1. **Install com0com** and create two virtual serial ports, (e.g. `COM5` and `COM6`).

2. In the **ELM327-Emulator**, set the port to `COM6`.

3. In your **Python code**, set the connection port to `COM5`.

## Contributing & Development

The development of this library follows the [ELM327 PDF](/docs/ELM327.PDF) provided by Elm Electronics, with the goal of implementing most features and commands as outlined, starting from page 6 of the document.

This library aims to deliver robust error handling, comprehensive logging, complete type hinting support, and follow best practices to create a reliable tool.

Please, feel free to contribute and share your feedback !

## Testing the Library with Pytest

This library uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing. To run the tests, you need to install the library with the [test] extra option.

1. **Install the library with "test" extra options**:
    ```bash
    pip install py-obdii[test]
    ```

2. **Run tests**:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
