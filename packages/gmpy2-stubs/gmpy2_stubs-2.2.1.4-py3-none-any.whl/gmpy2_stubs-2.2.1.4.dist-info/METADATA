Type stubs for the [gmpy2](https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/) library (version 2.2.1).

gmpy2 is a C-coded Python extension module that supports multiple-precision arithmetic. It provides access to the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library), MPFR (Multiple-Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library), and MPC (Multiple-Precision Complex Library) libraries. gmpy2 itself does *not* include type hints. This package provides them.

## IMPORTANT CAVEAT: gmpy2 Runtime Behavior

**Please be aware:** The underlying `gmpy2` library, which these stubs provide type hints for, **can crash the Python interpreter in case of memory allocation failure.** This is due to the memory management behavior of the wrapped GMP library.

To mitigate this risk when using `gmpy2` in your code:
*   **Estimate the potential size of calculation results.**
*   **Prevent or handle calculations that could exhaust available system memory.**

Failure to account for this may lead to unexpected program termination.

## Installation

```bash
pip install gmpy2-stubs
```

or, if you'd like to use a specific version:

```bash
pip install gmpy2-stubs==2.2.1.3
```

## Usage

These stubs are automatically used by static type checkers like [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) when you have both `gmpy2` and `gmpy2-stubs` installed. You do *not* need to import anything from `gmpy2-stubs` directly.

```python
import gmpy2

# Type hints are available here!
x = gmpy2.mpz(123)
y = gmpy2.sqrt(x)
print(y)
```

## Limitations: `inspect.signature()`

It's important to understand that these stubs are designed for *static* type checking.  They will *not* affect the behavior of runtime introspection tools like `inspect.signature()`.

gmpy2, like many C extension modules, does not provide complete runtime signature information.  The standard library's `inspect.signature()` function relies on information that is usually available for pure Python functions (like docstrings and argument annotations) but is often missing or incomplete for C extensions.

There have been discussions about improving this situation, including:

*   **gmpy2 issue #496:** [Type declarations to allow integration with type checking and linting tools](https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy/issues/496) - Discusses the general problem and potential solutions (including this stub package!).
*   **CPython issue #121945:** [Use *.pyi stub files as source for the inspect.signature()](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121945) - A proposal to make `inspect.signature()` use stub files as a fallback, but this was **closed as not planned**.

Therefore, if you use `inspect.signature()` on gmpy2 functions, you will likely get a generic signature (e.g., `(*args, **kwargs)`) rather than a detailed one.  This is a limitation of the current Python introspection mechanisms, *not* a limitation of these stubs.  The stubs *will* provide full type information to static type checkers.
