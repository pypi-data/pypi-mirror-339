# Commi: AI-powered Git Commit Message Generator

Commi is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates Git commit messages based on your code changes. It uses Google's **Gemini AI** to analyze your Git diffs and suggest meaningful, descriptive commit messages. Commi helps save time and ensures your commit history is consistent and descriptive.

## Features

- **AI-powered commit message generation**: Suggest commit messages based on the code changes using Google's Gemini AI.

- **Direct commit**: Generate and commit the suggested commit message directly to your repository.
- **Clipboard integration**: Optionally copy the generated commit message to your clipboard for easy pasting.
<!-- - **Future updates**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines, support for different languages, and customizable commit message templates. -->

   cd commi
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

# or run it from everywhere and pass the repo path as an argument

```

You can also download the pre-built binary for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Emad/commi/releases).

Now you're ready to use **Commi**!

## Usage

After installation, you can use the command-line interface (CLI) to generate commit messages.

### Basic Usage

To generate a commit message based on the latest changes in your repository:

```bash
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo"
```

### Use Staged Changes

If you want to generate a commit message based on the staged changes:

```bash
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo" --cached
```

### Set an API Key

You can provide your API key directly via the `--api-key` option:

```bash
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo" --api-key "your_api_key"
```

Alternatively, you can set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export COMMI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo"
```

If no API key is provided, a default API key will be used.

### Copy the Commit Message to Clipboard

To copy the generated commit message to your clipboard, use the `--copy` flag:

```bash
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo" --copy
```

This requires the installation of `xclip` (on Linux systems). If it's not installed, Commi will attempt to install it automatically.

### Regenerate a Commit Message

To regenerate the commit message, you can simply run the command one more time:

```bash
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo"
```

### Commit the suggested Commit Message

To commit the generated commit message, use the `--commit` flag:

```bash
commi --repo "/path/to/your/repo" --commit
```

## Configuration

Commi uses a `.env` file to configure certain settings. You can modify the following settings:

- `COMMI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini AI API key.
- `MODEL_NAME`: The AI model to use for commit message generation (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`).
