        Makes a call to an external API using provided configuration and
        returns the response.

        Summary:
        The function constructs a request based on the given API
        configuration and validated data, including headers, parameters,
        and other request settings. It utilizes the `requests` library
        to send the API call and processes the response. If a fallback
        value is supplied, it is returned in case of any failure during
        the API call. If no fallback is provided, a validation error is
        raised.

        Parameters:
            config:
                An object containing the configuration details for the
                external API call, such as URL, headers, method, and API key.
            fallback:
                The value to be returned in case the external API call fails.
            validated_data:
                The dictionary containing data used to replace placeholders
                in the URL and parameters of the API request.

        Returns:
            Optional[Any]:
                The JSON-decoded response from the API, or the fallback
                value if the call fails and a fallback is provided.

        Raises:
            ValidationError
                Raised if the external API call does not succeed and no
                fallback value is provided.
