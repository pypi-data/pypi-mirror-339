              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

# CodecovCLI

[![Build-Test-Upload](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli/actions/workflows/push_flow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli/actions/workflows/push_flow.yml)

CodecovCLI is a new way for users to interact with Codecov directly from the user’s terminal or CI platform. Many Codecov features that require the user’s interference can be done via the codecovCLI. It saves commits, creates reports, uploads coverage and has many more features.

# Installing

## Using PIP
To use codecov-cli in your local machine, or your CI workflows, you need to install it:

`pip install codecov-cli`

The above command will download the latest version of Codecov-cli. If you wish to use a specific version, releases can be viewed [here](https://pypi.org/project/codecov-cli/#history).

Note: If you're installing in a `pyenv` environment, you may need to call `pyenv rehash` before the CLI will work.

## As a Binary
If you would like to use the CLI in an environment that does not have access to Python / PIP, you can install the CLI as a compiled binary. Linux and macOS releases can be found [here](https://cli.codecov.io/), along with SHASUMs and signatures for each released version. Binary releases are also available via [Github releases](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli/releases) on this repository.

You can retrieve the Binary for Linux directly from your command line as follows:

```
curl -Os https://cli.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov
sudo chmod +x codecov
./codecov --help
```

### Integrity Checking the Binary

The binary can be integrity checked using a SHASUM256 and SHASUM256.sig file. The process for macos and Linux is identical. Linux is as follows:

```
curl https://keybase.io/codecovsecurity/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --import # One-time step
curl -Os https://cli.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov
curl -Os https://cli.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov.SHA256SUM
curl -Os https://cli.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov.SHA256SUM.sig

gpgv codecov.SHA256SUM.sig codecov.SHA256SUM

shasum -a 256 -c codecov.SHA256SUM
```

For macos you will want to use the macos distributions of the binary (e.g., https://cli.codecov.io/latest/macos/codecov)


# How to Upload to Codecov
If desired, the CLI can be used as a replacement for our [NodeJS Binary Uploader](https://github.com/codecov/uploader). To use the CLI to upload from your CI workflow, you need to add these commands:

```
pip install codecov-cli
codecovcli create-commit
codecovcli create-report
codecovcli do-upload
```
OR
```
pip install codecov-cli
codecovcli upload-process
```
codecovcli upload-process is a wrapper for create-commit, create-report and do-upload.

You can customize the commands with the options aligned with each command.

Note that these commands will automatically search your environment for a `$CODECOV_TOKEN` environment variable and use it if found. If you do not have a repository upload token, or global upload token, stored as an environment variable, you will need to pass it into **each command manually**, like so: `-t {$CODECOV_TOKEN}`.

## How to Get an Upload Token
The following tokens are suitable for uploading:

* The [Repository Upload Token](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-uploader#upload-token): Found on the settings page of your repository, also viewable on the `/new` page when setting up a repository on Codecov for the first time.
* The [Global Upload Token](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-uploader#organization-upload-token): Found on your organization settings page (e.g., `https://app.codecov.io/account/<scm>/<org>/org-upload-token`).

# Usage
If the installation is successful, running `codecovcli --help` will output the available commands along with the different general options that can be used with them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For up-to-date command usage, please check the `codecovcli_commands` [file](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli/blob/main/codecovcli_commands)

```
Usage: codecovcli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```
Codecov-cli supports user input. These inputs, along with their descriptions and usage contexts, are listed in the table below:

| Input  | Description | Usage |
| :---:     |     :---:   |    :---:   |
| `--auto-load-params-from`  | The CI/CD platform   | Optional |
| `--codecov-yml-path` | The path for your codecov.yml  | Optional
| `--enterprise-url` | Change the upload host (Enterprise use) | Optional
| `--version` | Codecov-cli's version | Optional
| `--verbose` or `-v` | Run the cli with verbose logging | Optional

# Codecov-cli Commands
| Command  | Description |
| :---:     |     :---:   |
| `create-commit` | Saves the commit's metadata in codecov, it's only necessary to run this once per commit
| `create-report` | Creates an empty report in codecov with initial data e.g. report name, report's commit
| `do-upload` | Searches for and uploads coverage data to codecov
| `create-report-results` | Used for local upload. It tells codecov that you finished local uploading and want it to calculate the results for you to get them locally.
| `get-report-results` | Used for local upload. It asks codecov to provide you the report results you calculated with the previous command.
| `pr-base-picking` | Tells codecov that you want to explicitly define a base for your PR
| `upload-process` | A wrapper for 3 commands. Create-commit, create-report and do-upload. You can use this command to upload to codecov instead of using the previously mentioned commands.
| `send-notifications` | A command that tells Codecov that you finished uploading and you want to be sent notifications. To disable automatically sent notifications please consider adding manual_trigger to your codecov.yml, so it will look like codecov: notify: manual_trigger: true.
>**Note**: Every command has its own different options that will be mentioned later in this doc. Codecov will try to load these options from your CI environment variables, if not, it will try to load them from git, if not found, you may need to add them manually.

## empty-upload

Used if the changes made don't need testing, but PRs require a passing codecov status to be merged.
This command will scan the files in the commit and send passing status checks configured if all the changed files
are ignored by codecov (including README and configuration files)

# How to Use Local Upload

The CLI also supports "dry run" local uploading. This is useful if you prefer to see Codecov status checks and coverage reporting locally, in your terminal, as opposed to opening a PR and waiting for your full CI to run. Local uploads do not interfere with regular uploads made from your CI for any given commit / Pull Request.

Local Upload is accomplished as follows:

```
pip install codecov-cli
codecovcli create-commit
codecovcli create-report --code <CODE>
codecovcli do-upload --report-code <CODE>
codecovcli create-report-results --code <CODE>
codecovcli get-report-results --code <CODE>
```

Codecov will calculate the coverage results, and return them in your terminal, telling you whether your PR will fail or pass the coverage check.

Note: In order for Local Upload to work, it must be used against a commit on the origin repository. Local Upload does not work for arbitrary diffs or uncommitted changes on your local machine.

# Work in Progress Features

The following features are somewhat implemented in code, but are not yet meant for use. These features will be documented once they are fully implemented in the CLI.

## Plugin System

To provide extensibility to some of its commands, the CLI makes use of a plugin system. For most cases, the default commands are sufficient. But in some cases, having some custom logic specific to your use case can be beneficial. Note that full documentation of the plugin system is pending, as the feature is still heavily a work in progress.

## Static Analysis

The CLI can perform basic static analysis on Python code today. This static analysis is meant to power more future looking Codecov features and, as such, is not required or in active use today. As more functionality dependent on static analysis becomes available for use, we will document static analysis in detail here.

# Contributions

This repository, like all of Codecov's repositories, strives to follow our general [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/codecov/contributing). If you're considering making a contribution to this repository, we encourage review of our Contributing guidelines first.

## Requirements

Most of this package is a very conventional Python package. The main difference is the static the CLI's analysis module uses both git submodules and C code

Before installing, one should pull the submodules with:

```
git submodule update --init
```
Then, install dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install --editable .
```

The C code shouldn't require any additional setup to get running, but depending on your environment, you may be prompted to install compilers and supporting tools. If errors are generated during installation, it is likely due to missing dependencies / tools required of the C code. In many cases, resulting error messages should be clear enough to determine what is missing and how to install it, but common errors will be collected here as they are encountered.

## Guidelines

There are a few guidelines when developing in this system. Some notable folders:

1. `commands` - It's the folder that interacts with the caller. This is where the commands themselves should reside. These commands are not meant to do heavy lifting. They only do wiring, which is mostly parsing the input parameters.
2. `services` - It's where the heavy logic resides. It's mostly organized by which command needs them. Commands should generally be thin wrappers around these services.
3. `helpers` - This is meant for logic that is useful across different commands. For example, logging helpers, or the logic that searches folders.

## Dependencies

If external dependencies need to be added, it's important to check whether those dependencies have wheels available on PyPI with the `any` or `universal2` platform tags. If those dependencies don't have those wheels available, then they will need to built during the CI, so they will have to be added to the list of
dependencies in the `--no-binary` flag when building the requirements for the macos release in `build_assets.yml`.

# Releases

The standard way to making a new release is the following:
1)  Open a PR that increases the version number in pyproject.toml. As a rule of thumb, just add one to the micro/patch version (e.g., v0.1.6 -> v0.1.7).

2) Get the up-to-date master branch locally and run the `tag.release` command from the Makefile.

`$ make tag.release version=v<VERSION_NUM>`

The version tag must match the regex defined on the Makefile (`tag_regex := ^v([0-9]{1,}\.){2}[0-9]{1,}([-_]\w+)?$`).

>**Note**: \
>Releases with `test` word in them are created as `draft`. \
>Releases with `beta` word in them are created as `pre-release`.
