# CellTypeMark

CellTypeMark is a Python package for cell type annotation in single-cell RNA sequencing data using marker genes. It provides tools for scoring and annotating cell types based on predefined marker gene sets.

## Features

- Score cell types using marker genes (using scanpy score_genes)
- Automatic cell type annotation based on marker gene expression
- Visualization of cell type annotations
- Integration with Scanpy and AnnData objects
- Support for custom marker gene sets

## Installation

```bash
pip install celltypemark
```

## Usage

```python
import scanpy as sc
import celltypemark as ctm

# Load your AnnData object
adata = sc.read_h5ad("your_data.h5ad")

# Score cell types using default marker genes
adata = ctm.score(adata, ctm.marker_genes)

# Score cell types using specified marker genes
## Example, Tabula_Muris
from pathlib import Path
resource_path = Path("your gene marker file")
marker_genes = ctm.load_resource(resource_path, resource_url='https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/geneSetLibrary?mode=text&libraryName=Tabula_Muris')
# For using marker sets from enrichr, uppercase var_names
adata.var_names = adata.var_names.str.upper()
adata = ctm.score(adata, marker_genes)

# Annotate cell types
adata = ctm.mark(adata, ctm.marker_genes, by='leiden', save='results', plot=True)
```

### Output

Add in the adata.obs:
- the scores of the keys in the gene sets for each observation
- the predicted key for each observation
- (if by) the predicted key for each by group, e.g., leiden
- (if save) save the scores of the keys for each by group in a txt file and the heatmap of the data under cellmarkoutput/
