# Celery Rules

## Task Organization
- Tasks must be organized in a `tasks` module within each app
- Task names must follow pattern: `<app_name>.<task_name>`
- Each task must have explicit queue assignment
- Implement retry policies for network-dependent tasks
- Use task versioning for long-running tasks

## Worker Configuration
- Use dedicated workers per queue type
- Configure memory limits per worker
- Set concurrency based on task type
- Enable worker heartbeat monitoring
- Configure task timeouts appropriately

## Task Implementation
- Use shared_task decorator for reusable apps
- Add task description in docstring
- Include expected runtime in task metadata
- Implement proper status tracking
- Use TaskManager model for task state management

## Monitoring Rules
- All tasks must emit status events
- Implement task progress tracking via TaskManager
- Log task start/end times
- Track task memory usage
- Use TaskWatcher for notification management
