# Main dependencies

## Guideline

- Split dependencies in group as much as possible

## Rules for new dependencies

- Do not use dependencies in maintenance mode
- Do not use deprecated dependencies
- Do not use archived dependencies
- Do not insist in the community side when the dependency is abandoned
- Do not use dependencies with very low activity in the main repository (check last commit and last pull request date)
- Avoid Dependency Confusion Attacks
- Check if there are any reference about that dependency is trying to attack they users
- Prevent Dependency chain abuse risk

## dependency file

- [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)

## Package manager

- Hatch
