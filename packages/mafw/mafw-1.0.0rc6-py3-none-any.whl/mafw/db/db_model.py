        Perform a so-called standard upsert.

        An upsert statement is not part of the standard SQL and different databases have different ways to implement it.
        This method will work for modern versions of :link:`sqlite` and :link:`postgreSQL`.
        Here is a `detailed explanation for SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org/lang_upsert.html>`_.

        An upsert is a statement in which we try to insert some data in a table where there are some constraints.
        If one constraint is failing, then instead of inserting a new row, we will try to update the existing row
        causing the constraint violation.

        A standard upsert, in the naming convention of MAFw, is setting the conflict cause to the primary key with all
        other fields being updated. In other words, the database will try to insert the data provided in the table, but
        if the primary key already exists, then all other fields will be updated.

        This method is equivalent to the following:

        .. code-block:: python

            class Sample(MAFwBaseModel):
                sample_id = AutoField(
