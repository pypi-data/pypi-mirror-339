## Pyref: The blazingly fast X-ray analysis toolkit

Pyref is a X-ray analysis toolkit based on the software libraries [pypxr](https://github.com/usnistgov/P-RSoXR), 
[kkcalc](https://github.com/benajamin/kkcalc), and [refnx](https://github.com/refnx/refnx). This is a work in progress to transition these projects into a more throughput oriented. The end goal is to combine the benefits of rust with the usability of python, taking advantage of Polars. This toolkit provides the means to analyse X-ray experimental data
