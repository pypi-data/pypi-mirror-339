# Artefacts Toolkit (Rosbag Helpers)

A part of the Artefacts Toolkit, this package contains helpers to be used when working with Rosbags (either mcap or sqlite).

Primarily designed to be used with Artefacts, the package can also be used standalone.

## Prerequisites

* Requires ROS 2 to be sourced.
* When using in a virtual environment, you may need to add your site packages to `PYTHONPATH`

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<your_workspace>/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```
## Usage
```
from artefacts_toolkit_rosbag import image_topics, message_topics, rosbag
```
