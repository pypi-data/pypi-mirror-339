def _get_real_fcf(ticker):
    """
    Retrieve the base free cash flow (FCF) for the given ticker using yfinance.

    This function attempts to use the "Free Cash Flow" row from the cash flow statement.
    If that row is not present, it calculates FCF as:
         FCF = Total Cash From Operating Activities + Capital Expenditures
    Note: Values are returned as provided by yfinance and may be in millions or billions.

    Parameters:
      ticker (str): Stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL").

    Returns:
      float: The free cash flow for the most recent period.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If no cash flow data or the required keys are found.
