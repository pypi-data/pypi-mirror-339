# mrftools

Python / pip package for managing MRF sequence definitions, dictionary definitions, bloch simulation results, and more. Utilizes HDF5 interchange format (.mrf files).

## Features
1. MRF Sequence definitions
    - Intended to define a sequence for execution on the scanner or within a bloch simulation
    - Supports timepoints with varying TR, TE, and FA
    - Supports multiple "beats" with varying RRTime, PrepTime, and PrepID
    - Can be defined programatically via Python, via .txt import, or via .mrf import
    - Can be exported to .txt format or .mrf format (** txt export not implemented fully **)
2. MRF Dictionary definitions 
    - Intended to define a set of dictionary entries to be used by a bloch simulation
    - Supports entries with varying T1, T2, and B0 values
    - Can be defined programatically via Python, via .txt import, or via .mrf import
    - Can be exported to .txt format or .mrf format
3. MRF Simulation definitions
    - Intended to specify and execute a bloch simulation of a specific sequence over a specific dictionary set
    - Configurable phase range and number of isochromat spins
    - Can either store all isochromat results or perform averaging before saving dictionary
    - Results and configuration can be exported to .mrf format
