    "# Induction Heads in Gemma 7B\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Penzai's primary goals is to support interpretability research on state-of-the-art models. In this notebook, we'll use Penzai to try to find and intervene on induction heads ([Elhage et al. 2021](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#induction-heads), [Olsson et al. 2022](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html)) in the [Gemma 7B](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-report.pdf) open-weights model.\n",
    "We'll be focusing on exploratory analysis and on Penzai's tooling rather than on rigor; the goal is to show how you can use Penzai to quickly prototype ideas and generate hypotheses about network behavior (not to perfectly measure the presence of induction heads or exactly reproduce previous results).\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll discuss:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to use JAX's sharding support to automatically shard the model over a cluster of TPUs,\n",
    "- How to use Penzai's pretty-printer (Treescope) to quickly look at model weights and activations,\n",
    "- How to extract intermediate values and intermediate subcomputations from a larger model for detailed analysis, using either Penzai's manual patching tool `pz.select` or using Penzai's data-effect system,\n",
    "- How to use Penzai's named axis library to identify the characteristic patterns of induction heads,\n",
    "- And how to patch the Gemma model by intervening on intermediate subcomputations (in this case, the attention weights),\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This version of this tutorial uses the 7-billion parameter Gemma model, which requires an accelerator with at least 24GB+ of RAM. (Colab \"TPU v2\" or Kaggle TPU kernels should work.) For a version with a smaller memory footprint, see the [\"Induction Heads in Gemma 2B\"](induction_heads_2B.ipynb) tutorial, which covers the same material.*"

If you want, you can do something similar in Penzai, by saving the activations into mutable `pz.StateVariable` instances and then retrieving and swapping them out later.\n",

One copy (the \"indirect stream\") could be in charge of receiving the updates from each transformer block and passing them to the other blocks.

This decomposition is essentially the \"path expansion\" trick of Elhage et al. (2021).\n",

    "Finally, we can apply one more trick: Let's think of Copy A and Copy B as being different *minibatch elements* of the same computation. In other words, let's add a new length-2 batch axis (let's call it \"worlds\") to our inputs and all of our intermediate values, such that `intermediate[{\"worlds\": 0}]` is the value this intermediate would have in the indirect stream or in copy A, and `intermediate[{\"worlds\": 1}]` is the value it would have in the direct stream or in copy B. Then we just need to make two changes to our model:\n",
    "- When we are applying our `KnockOutAttentionHeads` layer, we'll add a \"worlds\" axis to the mask. If we're ablating the direct path, `mask[{\"worlds\": 0}]` will be 1 everywhere, but `mask[{\"worlds\": 1}]` will have zeros at the parts we want to mask out.\n",
    "- Inside each residual block, before the layer norm, we'll add a new \"rewiring\" step where we copy `intermediate[{\"worlds\": 0}]` to `intermediate[{\"worlds\": 1}]`. This ensures that the \"Copy B\" versions still see the indirect stream as input, instead of reading the direct stream.\n",

    "Because Penzai models let you insert logic anywhere, and all of our model's layers vectorize over batch axes by name, these are both pretty easy to accomplish! We'll use a simple helper class to make it a bit clearer what we're doing."

    "- An MLP layer might be amplifying the output of the induction heads.\n",
    "  - Gemma uses GEGLU MLP layers, which have multiplicative interactions between two sets of features. So we could further decompose this into two cases: it could be amplifying the head's output in a linear way (e.g. using it only in the linear features) or amplifying it in a nonlinear way (e.g. using it in the \"gating\" features with a GELU activation).\n",
    "- Another attention head might be amplifying the output of induction heads.\n",
    "  - It could do this by attending to this token and copying its value in a linear way.\n",
    "  - It could also in principle do this by using the induction head outputs to modify the queries and the keys, changing how information is routed. (This seems a bit unlikely, because the induction heads have already moved the information into the right place, but it's possible.)\n",
    "- Or, it could be some combination of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to isolate the effects of these different paths with a more complex rewiring configuration, by progressively enabling more computation paths:\n",

    "- In the \"restore_direct\" setting, we'll restore the induction heads, but rewire every layer's input to read from the \"fully_ablated\" world. Thus, the only path from those induction heads is the direct path to the output.\n",
    "- In the \"restore_direct_attnvalue\" setting, we'll rewire the query and key heads of the attention blocks to read from the \"fully_ablated\" world (freezing the attention pattern), but we'll allow the value head to act normally. This additionally enables paths that pass through later attention heads without changing their attention pattern.\n",
    "- In the \"restore_direct_attnall\" setting, we'll further allow the query and key projections to see the output of the induction heads, allowing attention patterns to change.\n",

This additionally enables linear paths through the MLP layers.\n",

    "- Just restoring the direct path increases the (relative) logit of the correct answers a fair amount (by about 1.5), as we've seen before.\n",
    "- Additionally restoring the attention-value path yields another increase of about 1.1.\n",
    "- However, if we also restore the query-key circuit's effect on the attention patterns, the average logit score actually decreases by about 0.9. This suggests that changes to later attention patterns modulate *down* the effect of the induction heads.\n",
    "  - For this experiment's ablation masks, we're restoring all four heads, so this could have something to do with the interaction between block 20 and block 21 that we mentioned previously. Perhaps block 21's heads compensate for block 20's head being inactive, and copy less strongly if it's active.\n",
    "- When we restore the linear path throught the MLPs, we see a large increase in the logit score (about 3.7).\n",
    "  - This suggests that the MLPs are very sensitive to the copied value in the ablated setting.\n",
    "- When we restore the nonlinear path as well, this drops down again by about 1.7.\n",
    "  - Also, though the logits across the tokens become \"smoother\" across the sequence, varying less from token to token. For instance, the token at index 36 has an unusually small logit value in the ablated settings, but has a fairly normal predicted logit in the fully-restored condition.\n",

    "Looks like this still doesn't produce copying behavior. So, the second hypothesis is more likely to be true: there are probably MLP layers that are scrubbing out the contributions of this attention head, or at least not amplifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this is consistent with the behavior we observed in the previous section! We observed that the induction heads were being modulated in a nonlinear fashion by the MLP layers, and that those MLP layers were locally highly sensitive to the output of the induction heads."

    "Summarizing what we've found:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the model is given random integer digit sequences, it looks like there are induction heads in blocks 5, 14, 20, and 21. By ablating them, we determined that preserving at least one head from blocks 20 and 21 is both necessary and sufficient for the model to confidently copy digits from its input.\n",
    "- Ablating individual linear and nonlinear paths through the model revealed that there are contributions through the direct output of the layer, through later attention heads, and through MLPs. However, there is a nonlinear modulating effect from both later attention patterns and the nonlinear MLP activations.\n",
    "- Running activation patching between counterfactual inputs showed that, if the model has decided to copy, we can change *what* it copies by patching in the induction head value projections. This is causal evidence that the model is using those value projections to make its prediction.\n",
    "- On the other hand, we *can't* seem to make the model *decide* to copy by patching in the attention pattern of the induction heads, or by patching in both the attention pattern and the copied values. This suggests that the MLP layers may be playing a role in \"gating\" these induction heads, and determining whether those outputs make their way to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we've demonstrated how to:\n",
    "- Look at all sorts of high-dimensional named-axis arrays using Penzai's autovisualizer and `treescope.render_array`, optionally adding useful annotations of our own to the tooltips,\n",
    "- Look at token sequences with the `token_visualization` tool\n",
    "- Visualize the structure of the pretrained Gemma model\n",
    "- Inject new logic into that model using `pz.select`\n",
    "- Use the named axis system to identify likely induction heads\n",
    "- Write our own patching logic to knock out attention heads\n",
    "- Run complex path-rewiring experiments in vectorized form by adding a \"worlds\" axis\n",
    "- Linearize MLPs and layer norm blocks around their activations in different parallel \"worlds\"\n",
    "- And combine these to perform causal interventions on different activations within the model and between different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook demonstrates the flexibility of the Penzai toolkit, and how easy it is to compose different ablations, reroute various activation paths in a declarative way, and quickly iterate on our analysis  without having to manage mutable state or manually cache different model activations. It's also worth emphasizing again that this model is sharded across multiple accelerator devices using the power of the XLA compiler, and that the computation across our parallel counterfactual \"worlds\" is also fully vectorized and parallelizable."

    "There's clearly more interesting behavior to explore about these circuits, but we'll stop here and leave this exploration to the reader. Some interesting questions you might explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can you design a set of rewirings that would identify whether the head in block 20 is indeed influencing the attention patterns in block 21?\n",
    "- Why is restoring any one of these heads is sufficient to restore the overall copying behavior we've observed?\n",
    "- What are the other induction heads (in block 5 and 14) doing, given that they aren't enough to implement the copying behavior on their own?\n",
    "- What part of the model is responsible for deciding when it should copy and when it shouldn't copy? Can you figure out a minimal set of activations we can patch in from the repeating sequence to trick the model into copying the non-repeating sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note that the components `KnockOutAttentionHeads`, `RewireComputationPaths`, and `LinearizeAndAdjust` used in this notebook are also available in Penzai under `penzai.toolshed.model_rewiring`, so you can use them in your own notebooks without copying their definitions. But don't feel limited by those layers! Penzai makes it easy to add custom logic to the models, so you can perform whatever modification you want."
