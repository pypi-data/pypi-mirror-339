Usage
=====

In case that the confirmation of the Stock Request results in an
immediate Manufacturing Order, the user will be able to display the MO's
from the Stock Request form view.

Navigate to Stock Requests and create a new stock request. Upon
confirmation of the stock request, the system will automatically
generate the corresponding manufacturing order. View and manage the
generated manufacturing orders directly from the stock request record or
through Manufacturing.
