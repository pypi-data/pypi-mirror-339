▶️ VIEW
=======

Introduction
------------
View are provided as examples and are decorrelated from the project.
In fact, when you need to develop a view for your project, you can decide to publish it as
an Agilag view. For this, you should have some Streamlit knowledge.
The only link with your project is in ``app_settings.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

    [views]
    view_module = [<list of view-module>]

    [<view_module_xxx>]
    variables = [<list of columns names you want to make available in your view_module_xxx>]

Sidebar

This is a listbox to select a project to be loaded from the existing ones.

Main Content Area
