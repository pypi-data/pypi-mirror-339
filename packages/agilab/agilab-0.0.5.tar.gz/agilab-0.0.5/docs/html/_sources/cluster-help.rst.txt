Cluster Help
============

Overview
--------

A cluster of computer is not mandatory to use agilab but it will enable to run your project at scale which is the
foundation idea of agi-core.

Principle
---------
a cluster is composed of computers identified by their IP v4 address that are generally name nodes. One of this node
will play the role of scheduler and the others are workers matching the Dask[distributed] concept. Agilab will ask
agi-core to install your project on each nodes. In order to proceed it requires each node to run a ssh server.
The node on which agilab run will use ssh client to connect to each node. So that is why you need to generate keys
from your Agillab node and then copy it to each nodes of your cluster.
