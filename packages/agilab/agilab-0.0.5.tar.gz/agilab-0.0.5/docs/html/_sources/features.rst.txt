Features
========

AGI framework offers 2 user interfaces:

 - `agi-core` an API interface to interface directly in your python program on a `dask cluster <https://openai.com>`_
 - `agilab` a WEB interface that generate the agi-core API call in a snippet and offer `openai <https://openai.com>`_ code assitant.

There is share components `agi-env` a share component to set the environment and `agi-gui` the Graphic User Interface engine

agi-core
--------

- **Automated Virtual Environment Setup:**

  - Automatically installs virtual environments for cluster nodes which are computers with multi-cores CPU, GPU and NPU.

- **Flexible Application Run Modes:**

  - **Process Management:**

    - Single Process
    - Multiple Processes

  - **Language Support:**

    - Pure Python (From python 3.12)
