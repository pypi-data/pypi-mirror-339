   .. tab-item:: Lab-Directory

      Select your module name.
      The ``Lab_directory`` is defined as ``AGI_LAB_DIR / "your selected module"``,
      where ``AGIL_LAB_DIR`` is the variable from ``~/.env``.
      If it has not been set, the default value is:
      ``"~/agilab/framework/agi-gui"``

   .. tab-item:: Dataframe

      The relative path of your dataframe.
      The absolute path will be ``AGI_EXPORT_DIR / "your input dataframe relative path"``,
      where ``AGI_EXPORT_DIR`` is the variable from ``~/.env``.
      If it has not been set, the default value is:
      ``"~/export"``

   .. tab-item:: Import Notebook

      Select the notebook file you want to import in the "Main Content Area".

      This is an optional field in case you are not connected to the internet but want
      to get some snippets to work with.

   .. tab-item:: Open MLFlow UI

      If you have explicitly asked in your query to log the run for MLFlow,
      you can open the MLFlow UI to extend your experimentation.

   .. tab-item:: Step-File

      This is similar to a cell in a notebook.

   .. tab-item:: Notebook-File

      This is the name of the notebook file to export your experimentation.

   .. tab-item:: Save DataFrame

      This button will save your dataframe; otherwise, the result of your run will not be persistent.

   .. tab-item:: Save Notebook

      This button will save the export in the ``Notebook-File``.

   .. tab-item:: Open Notebook

      This will open a new tab with the ``Notebook-File`` in Jupyter Notebook.
