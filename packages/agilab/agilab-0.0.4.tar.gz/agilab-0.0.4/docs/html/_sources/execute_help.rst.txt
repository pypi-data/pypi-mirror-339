Introduction
------------
The principle is to `INSTALL` once your project, then you can optionally check the `DISTRIBUTE` and then `RUN` it.
By default, there is always a mode set, but if you don't know which one to use, you can manually remove it from the
snippet, which will lead to a read in all modes for benchmarking.

This is a listbox to select a project to be loaded from the existing ones.
