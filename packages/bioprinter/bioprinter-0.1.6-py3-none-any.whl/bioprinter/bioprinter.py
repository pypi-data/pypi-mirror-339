"""Bioprinter: print images with colored bacteria and yeast.

This implements the `bioprint` function, which takes an image and writes a CSV
file that the Labcyte Echo dispenser can use to print the pictures on a plate
using yeast, coli, ...

    """Generate a CSV file for Echo printing of an image.

    This function generates a CSV file for the Echo liquid
    handler to bioprint a given picture, using specified color wells.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_filename : str
        The path to the image file. The image can be any size and format, but
        should be suitable for low resolution yeast printing. Images taller than
        they are wide will automatically be rotated 90 degrees to maximize
        resolution while preserving aspect ratio.

    output_filename : str
        The name of the CSV file for the Echo.

    bg_color : tuple
        A triplet (R,G,B) of 0-255 integers indicating the background color of the original image (no pigment).

    pigments_wells : dict
        A dictionary of well names and the corresponding pigments (
        e.g., {"A1": [0, 10, 20], "B1": [...]}). Only one well per pigment is
        supported currently.

    resolution : tuple, optional
        Resolution (width, height) of the printing plate. You must define a
        plate with these exact same characteristics using the Echo software.
        Default is (192, 128), equivalent to twice the resolution of a
        1536-well plate. The aspect ratio of the image is preserved.

    transfer_volume : float, optional
        Volume in microliters of liquid used per pixel, default is 2.5 Î¼L.

    pigment_well_capacity : float
        Volume in microliters that each pigment well can dispense. Raises an
        error if required pigment for any color exceeds the content of the well,
        i.e. if ``transfer_volume * number_pixels > well_capacity``.

    transfer_rate : int, optional
        Average number of droplet transfers per second; used to estimate printing time.

    quantified_image_filename : str, optional
        Path to save the quantified version of the picture as an image file.

    Examples
    --------
