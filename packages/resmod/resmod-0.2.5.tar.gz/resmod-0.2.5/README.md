# resmod: A package for deriving orthogonalized interaction terms, reporting interaction analyses, and visualization of interactions

## Overview
**resmod** is a Python package to assist with deriving interactions and visualizing interactions. For deriving interactions - this package uses residual centering to orthogonalize the interaction from the items used to derive the interaction. Where traditional interaction approaches induce residual dependence that violate assumptions of regression and requires the user to estimate a model with and without the interaction, the approach taken with 'resmod' is an interaction term that does not violate assumptions of regression based approaches (no residual dependence). 

Why would you want to orthogonalize your interaction term by residual centering? Beyond retaining data properties that fit the assumptions of your analytic approach, this improves the ease of analysis as well as providing proper context to analyses that are preregistered. 

An example - you preregister an interaction that has strong theoretical support,  you run your analysis and find your interaction is statistically meaninful! Now it is time to interpret - a traditional approach would guide the analyst to forget about the direct estimates and only interpret the interaction... the problem is those direct effects are what guided you to your research question and proposing the interaction in the first place. 'resmod' allows you to leave your interaction term in your model, show your hypothesis test for the interaction, while also connecting to the literature in your field by being able to interpret direct effects. It would be critical to not only intprepret the interaction but also direct effects that has substantially more literautre support inorder to contextualize your results. 

A second example - your preregistered interaction is not statitically menaingful. A traditional approach would guide you to remove the interaction and move forward with interpreting direct effects... the problem with this approach is you had a strong theoretical reasoning for that interaction  and to remove it would undercut the main reason for conducting the analysis in the first place. 'resmod' allows you to leave that interaction term in the model so you can show your hypothesis test for the theoretically supported interaction term while interpretating direct effects to connect with the literature. 

Another common problem is writing code to plot these interactions and obtaining slope estimates at the points of interaction. 'resmod' provides basic plotting functions to visualize interactions as well as calculating simple slopes for two-way and three-way interactions for inspection or publication. 

In short 'resmod' provides tools for more robust interaction analysis that are more theoretically consistent without having to run multiple models on the same outcome and knowningly introducing assumption violations.  

## What is resmod? 
**resmod** is a Python package that provides the ability to quickly create orthogonalized interaction terms by centering residuals. This approach to testing interaction prevents the user from violating basic assumptions of regression -- specificaly that there should be no correlated residuals. Because the interaction term is orthogonalized from the model, you are able to interpret both direct effects and interaction terms in the same model. Not only is this convienient but it reduces the number of test run on your data. **resmod** also provides functionality to visualize two-way or three-way interactions for one or two interactions. Specifically, 'resmod.plotting.interact_plot()' uses the Bauer & Curran (2005) "pick a point" procedure (+1SD, mean, -1SD) for continuous variables (or chosen point values by the user) and points relevant for categorical or dichotomous values.     

## Whats next?
For the next version of **resmod** we are working on functions for bootstrapping of confidence intervals and deriving Johnson-Neyman intervals as well as related figures for evaluating/report for these approaches.
