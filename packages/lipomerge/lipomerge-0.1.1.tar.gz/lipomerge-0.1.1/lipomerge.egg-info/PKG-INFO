# lipomerge

This package merges two directories containing static libraries for two different architectures into one directory with universal binaries. Files that don't end in ".a" or are mach-O binaries (Typically `.dylib` or executable) will just be copied over from the first directory.

## Installation

To install the package, use:

```
pip install lipomerge
```

## Usage

Run it like this:

```
python3 -m lipomerge <arm64-dir-tree> <x64-dir-tree> <universal-output-dir>
```

## Requirements

- macOS
- `lipo` must be installed on your system.

## License

This project is licensed under the GPL v3 license.
