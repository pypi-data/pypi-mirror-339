# CalÃ§ot ðŸ§…ðŸ”¥

**CalÃ§ot** (pronounced "cal-sot") is a lighthearted, smoky parody of [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/).  
Itâ€™s named after the delicious Catalan grilled onion, the **calÃ§ot**.

> ðŸ§… Just like a calÃ§ot needs some fire to taste great, your tasks deserve to be grilled to perfection.
