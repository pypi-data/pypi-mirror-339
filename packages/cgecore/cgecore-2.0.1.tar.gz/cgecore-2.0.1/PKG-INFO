# CGE Core Module version 2 released

The cgecore module have been updated to version 2.0.0. Despite earlier announcements, we have decided  to try and keep most of the legacy functionality in version 2. All CGE tools should work with this updated version. However, we did not have the resources to test it with all CGE tools.
This version includes all functionality from the [cgelib package version 0.7.5](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/cgelib). The cgelib package has been deprecated and all functionality has been moved to the cgecore package. The cgecore package is now the one-stop core module for the Center for Genomic Epidemiology.

**Please note that some parts of the added functionality is still in development and tests are far from complete.**
