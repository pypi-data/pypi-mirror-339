Installation
============

The package can be fetched as `django-adminlink`, so for example with `pip` with:

.. code-block:: console
   
   pip3 install django-adminlink

The item is not a Django app, so one should *not* to include it in the `INSTALLED_APPS`. It is only a module that
offers some functionality to use in Django applications.
