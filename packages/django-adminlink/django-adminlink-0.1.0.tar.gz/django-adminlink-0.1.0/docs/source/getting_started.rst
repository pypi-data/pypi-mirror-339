Getting started

Once the package is installed, you can use the `LinkFieldAdminMixin` mixin in the admins where you want `ForeignKey`s and `OneToOneField`s to be linked to the corresponding admin detail view of that object:

  .. code-block:: python3

   from django.contrib import admin


   @admin.register(Movie)
   class MovieAdmin(LinkFieldAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
       list_display = ['__str__', 'genre']

If `genre` is a `ForeignKey` to a `Genre` model for example, and `Genre` has its own `ModelAdmin`, it will automatically convert `genre` into a column that adds a link to the admin detail view of the corresponding genre.
