# crystalfontz.dbus.client

This module contains the core `DbusClient` abstraction, which is used to interact with a DBus service.

For information on how to use `crystalfontz` domain objects with the DBus client, see [the API docs for `crystalfontz.dbus.domain`](./crystalfontz.dbus.domain.md). For examples of how to use the DBus client, look at [the source code for `crystalfontzctl`](https://github.com/jfhbrook/crystalfontz/blob/main/crystalfontz/dbus/client/cli.py).
