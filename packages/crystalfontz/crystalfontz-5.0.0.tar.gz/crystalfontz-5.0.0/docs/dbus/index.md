# DBus Support

The `crystalfontz` library includes a DBus interface, service and client. This service allows for multitenancy on Linux - the centralized service controls the serial bus, and clients (including `crystalfontzctl`) can connect to the service.

For information on the API, visit [the API docs for dbus](../api/crystalfontz.dbus/index.md):
