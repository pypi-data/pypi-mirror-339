# Pydre Overview

Pydre (pronounced *pie-dray*) is a Python software package designed to analyze the raw driving data taken from real-time driving simulation research studies. 

Pydre was originally based on the output file format from the [SimObserver](https://www.faac.com/realtime-technologies/products/simobserver-pro/) system sold by Realtime Technologies for recording data from their SimCreator simulation system. However, it can also input data from Scanner software and any similar tabular time-series data.
