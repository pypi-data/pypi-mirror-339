**GraphOrchestrator** is a lightweight Python library for building and executing dynamic workflows as directed graphs. It allows you to define processing logic as **nodes**, control flow via **concrete and conditional edges**, and orchestrate execution with support for:

- ‚úÖ **Decorator-driven design** for node actions, routing logic, and aggregators  
- üîÅ **Retry policies** and fault-tolerant execution  
- üß† **Conditional branching** using routing functions  
- ü§ù **Parallel and aggregated state processing**  
- üé® **Graph visualization** with Matplotlib  
- üß™ **Built-in testability** with full unit test coverage  

Whether you're designing decision engines, agent workflows, or data pipelines‚ÄîGraphOrchestrator offers an intuitive and extensible framework for graph-based execution.
