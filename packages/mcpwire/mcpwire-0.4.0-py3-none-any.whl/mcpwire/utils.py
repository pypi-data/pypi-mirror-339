    Safely joins a base URL and a relative path segment.

    Ensures there's exactly one slash between the base URL's path component
    and the start of the relative path, handling potential trailing slashes
    in the base URL and leading slashes in the path.

    Args:
        base_url: The base URL (e.g., "http://localhost:8000", "http://api.example.com/v1").
        path: The relative path segment (e.g., "prompt", "/tools", "resources/res_123").

    Returns:
        The correctly joined full URL string.

    # urljoin handles joining correctly, including removing leading slashes from the path if needed
    # e.g., urljoin("http://host.com/v1/", "/path") -> "http://host.com/path" (correct)
    # e.g., urljoin("http://host.com/v1/", "path") -> "http://host.com/v1/path" (correct)
