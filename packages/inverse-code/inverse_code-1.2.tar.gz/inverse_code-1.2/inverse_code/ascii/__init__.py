ASCII, stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
This class shows the extended ASCII table which is based on the Windows-1252 character set which is an 8 bit ASCII table with 256 characters and symbols.
It includes all ASCII codes from standard ASCII, and it is a superset of ISO 8859-1 in terms of printable characters.
In the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), ISO/IEC 8859-1 has invisible control characters, while Windows-1252 has writable characters. Windows-1252 is probably the most-used 8-bit character encoding in the world.
