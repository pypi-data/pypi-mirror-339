# qcmd - AI-powered Command Generator

A simple command-line tool that generates shell commands using local AI models via Ollama.

**Version 1.0.12**

## Overview

**qcmd** is a powerful command-line tool that generates shell commands using AI language models via Ollama. Simply describe what you want to do in natural language, and qcmd will generate the appropriate command.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Inputs**: Describe what you want to do in plain English
- **Auto-fix Mode**: Automatically fixes failed commands and retries
- **AI Error Analysis**: Explains errors and suggests solutions
- **Interactive Shell**: Continuous operation with command history
- **Multiple Models**: Works with any Ollama model (default: qwen2.5-coder:0.5b)
- **Safety First**: Always asks for confirmation before executing any command
- **Log Analysis**: Find and analyze system log files with real-time monitoring

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running
- At least one language model pulled (e.g., qwen2.5-coder:0.5b)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install ibrahimiq-qcmd
```

Make sure Ollama is running before using qcmd:
```bash
ollama serve
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate and confirm a command
qcmd "list all files in the current directory"

# Auto-execute mode
qcmd -e "find large log files"

# Smart auto-fix mode
qcmd -A "find Python files modified today"

# Interactive shell
qcmd -s
```

## What's New in 1.0.12

- Add banner font customization with support for all pyfiglet fonts
- Add progress bar customization options
- Add compact mode for minimal output
- Switch to JSON-based configuration storage for better flexibility
- Add command-line flags for quick UI customization:
  - `--banner-font FONT` - Set the banner font (e.g., starwars, doom, colossal)
  - `--no-banner` - Disable the Iraq banner
  - `--no-progress` - Disable progress animations
  - `--compact` - Enable compact mode for minimal output
- Add new configuration options:
  - `ui.banner_font` - The font to use for the Iraq banner (any pyfiglet font)
  - `ui.show_progress_bar` - Whether to show the progress bar
