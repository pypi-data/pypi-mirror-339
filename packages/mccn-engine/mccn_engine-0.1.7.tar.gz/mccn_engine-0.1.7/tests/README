## Test criteria

### Vector

- load multi-layered file (using the `layer` keyword)
    - expects files to be loaded correctly
    - tests/files/unit_tests/vector/attribute.json

- load as attribute (bands from column_info)
    - expects described bands to be loaded
    - tests/files/unit_tests/vector/attribute.json

- load as mask (column_info is empty)
    - expects a layered with item id loaded as mask
    - tests/files/unit_tests/vector/mask.json

- load mask + attribute (some items have empty column_info, some have described column_info)
    - expects described bands and mask band (layer with item id)
    - tests/files/unit_tests/vector/mask_attribute.json

- rename non numeric fields
    - non numeric fields is encoded, with encoding stored as dc attribute
    - tests/files/unit_tests/vector/attribute.json

- combine similarly named attributes
    - different items that share the same attribute are combined into one single layer
    - tests/files/unit_tests/vector/attribute.json

- join vector with csv - join attribute vector described in column_info
- join vector with csv - join attribute vector not described in column_info
- join vector with csv - join field described in join_column_info
- join vector with csv - join field not described in join_column_info
- join vector with csv - with join_T_column
- join vector with csv - without join_T_column

- band processing and renaming
