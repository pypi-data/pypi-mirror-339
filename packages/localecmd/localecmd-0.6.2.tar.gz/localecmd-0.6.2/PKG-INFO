# localecmd â€“ the translatable command line
[[Code repository](https://codeberg.org/jbox/localecmd)] 
[[Documentation](https://jbox.codeberg.page/localecmd/)] 
[[Issue tracker](https://codeberg.org/jbox/localecmd/issues)]

A translatable command line interpreter to be extended with functions instead of methods. 

The localecmd command line interpreter has two main purposes:
- Function, parameter and type names can be translated into other languages with gettext.
- It is extended with functions. Thereby the same functions can be called also directly, 
without having to go by the CLI. A use case is that a GUI can access the functions directly.

## Installation
The localecmd package is easiest to install with pip
```bash
pip install localecmd
```
