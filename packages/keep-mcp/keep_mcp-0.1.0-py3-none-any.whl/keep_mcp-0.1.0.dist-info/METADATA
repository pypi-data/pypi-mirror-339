## How to use

1. Add the MCP server to your MCP servers:

```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "keep-mcp-pipx": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "keep-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_EMAIL": "Your Google Email",
        "GOOGLE_MASTER_TOKEN": "Your Google Master Token - see README.md"
      }
    }
  }
```

2. Add your credentials:
