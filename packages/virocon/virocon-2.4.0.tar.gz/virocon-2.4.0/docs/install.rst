Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure you have installed Python `3.11` or `3.12` by typing

.. code:: console

   python --version

(Older version might work, but are not actively tested)

If you do not (want to) use conda, consider using a python version management like pyenv_ .


Install
~~~~~~~
Install the latest version of virocon from PyPI by typing

.. code:: console

   pip install virocon


Alternatively, you can install from virocon repositoryâ€™s main branch
by typing

.. code:: console

   pip install https://github.com/virocon-organization/virocon/archive/main.zip


virocon is also available on `conda-forge`_. We recommend to first create a new environment.

.. code:: console

   conda create --name virocon python=3.12

And then activate that new environment and install virocon.

.. code:: console

   conda activate virocon
   conda install -c conda-forge virocon
