ContextGem is a free, open-source LLM framework for easier, faster extraction of structured data and insights from documents through powerful abstractions.


## üíé Why ContextGem?

Most popular LLM frameworks for extracting structured data from documents require extensive boilerplate code to extract even basic information. This significantly increases development time and complexity.

ContextGem addresses this challenge by providing a flexible, intuitive framework that extracts structured data and insights from documents with minimal effort. Complex, most time-consuming parts are handled with **powerful abstractions**, eliminating boilerplate code and reducing development overhead.

Read more on the project [motivation](https://contextgem.dev/motivation.html) in the documentation.


## üí° What can you do with ContextGem?

With ContextGem, you can:
- **Extract structured data** from documents (text, images) with minimal code
- **Identify and analyze key aspects** (topics, themes, categories) within documents
- **Extract specific concepts** (entities, facts, conclusions, assessments) from documents
- **Build complex extraction workflows** through a simple, intuitive API
- **Create multi-level extraction pipelines** (aspects containing concepts, hierarchical aspects)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -U contextgem
```


## üöÄ Quick start

```python
# Quick Start Example - Extracting anomalies from a document, with source references and justifications

import os

from contextgem import Document, DocumentLLM, StringConcept

# Example document instance
# Document content is shortened for brevity
doc = Document(
    raw_text=(
        "Consultancy Agreement\n"
        "This agreement between Company A (Supplier) and Company B (Customer)...\n"
        "The term of the agreement is 1 year from the Effective Date...\n"
        "The Supplier shall provide consultancy services as described in Annex 2...\n"
        "The Customer shall pay the Supplier within 30 calendar days of receiving an invoice...\n"
        "The purple elephant danced gracefully on the moon while eating ice cream.\n"  # üíé anomaly
        "This agreement is governed by the laws of Norway...\n"
    ),
)

# Attach a document-level concept
doc.concepts = [
    StringConcept(
        name="Anomalies",  # in longer contexts, this concept is hard to capture with RAG
        description="Anomalies in the document",
        add_references=True,
        reference_depth="sentences",
        add_justifications=True,
        justification_depth="brief",
    )
    # add more concepts to the document, if needed
    # see the docs for available concepts: StringConcept, JsonObjectConcept, etc.
]
# Or use doc.add_concepts([...])

# Create an LLM for extracting data and insights from the document
llm = DocumentLLM(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",  # or any other LLM from e.g. Anthropic, etc.
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "CONTEXTGEM_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    ),  # your API key for the LLM provider, e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
    # see the docs for more configuration options
)

# Extract information from the document
doc = llm.extract_all(doc)  # or use async version llm.extract_all_async(doc)

# Access extracted information in the document object
print(
    doc.concepts[0].extracted_items
)  # extracted items with references & justifications
# or doc.get_concept_by_name("Anomalies").extracted_items

```

## üéØ Focused document analysis

ContextGem leverages LLMs' long context windows to deliver superior extraction accuracy from individual documents. Unlike RAG approaches that often [struggle with complex concepts and nuanced insights](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/raging-contracts-pitfalls-rag-contract-review-shcherbak-ai-ptg3f), ContextGem capitalizes on [continuously expanding context capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12962), evolving LLM capabilities, and decreasing costs. This focused approach enables direct information extraction from complete documents, eliminating retrieval inconsistencies while optimizing for in-depth single-document analysis. While this delivers maximum accuracy for individual documents, ContextGem does not currently support cross-document querying or corpus-wide retrieval - for these use cases, traditional RAG systems (e.g., LlamaIndex, Haystack) remain more appropriate.

Read more on [how it works](https://contextgem.dev/how_it_works.html) in the documentation.


## ü§ñ Supported LLMs

ContextGem supports both cloud-based and local LLMs through [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) integration:
- **Cloud LLMs**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure OpenAI, and more
- **Local LLMs**: Run models locally using providers like Ollama, LM Studio, etc.
- **Simple API**: Unified interface for all LLMs with easy provider switching
