## Node.js Upgrade Guide: From Version 13.0 to 14.0

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all breaking changes, deprecations, and API modifications introduced when upgrading from Node.js 13.0 to 14.0. It is structured to help developers understand the changes and migrate their code effectively.

---

### 1. Summary of Major Changes

- **V8 Engine Upgrade**: Node.js 14 includes V8 version 8.1, introducing new JavaScript features like optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)[2][7].
- **Diagnostic Reporting**: The diagnostic reporting feature is now stable, enabling easier debugging of performance issues and crashes[2][7].
- **Removal of Experimental Modules Warning**: The warning for using ECMAScript Modules (ESM) has been removed, though the implementation remains experimental[7].
- **AsyncLocalStorage API**: A new experimental API for managing asynchronous context has been introduced[7].
- **Full ICU Support**: Node.js 14 is the first LTS release to include full ICU (International Components for Unicode) by default, enhancing internationalization capabilities[7].

### 2. Breaking Changes by Version

#### **Node.js 14.0.0**
1. **V8 Engine Upgrade**
   - **Affected Feature**: JavaScript engine updated to V8 8.1.
   - **What Changed**: Introduced new syntax features like optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`).
   - **Migration**: Ensure your codebase is compatible with these new features. Older JavaScript runtimes may not support these constructs.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     // Before
     const value = obj && obj.property;

     // After
     const value = obj?.property;
     ```

2. **Diagnostic Reporting**
   - **Affected Feature**: Diagnostic reporting is now stable.
   - **What Changed**: Developers can generate diagnostic reports for debugging directly from the application.
   - **Migration**: Use the `process.report` API to generate reports.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     process.report.writeReport('./diagnostic-report.json');
     ```

3. **Removal of Experimental Modules Warning**
   - **Affected Feature**: ECMAScript Modules (ESM).
   - **What Changed**: The warning for using ESM has been removed, though the feature remains experimental.
   - **Migration**: No action required unless relying on the warning for debugging.

4. **AsyncLocalStorage API**
   - **Affected Feature**: New experimental API for managing asynchronous context.
   - **What Changed**: Provides a simpler API compared to Async Hooks for managing context across asynchronous calls.
   - **Migration**: Use `AsyncLocalStorage` for context management.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const { AsyncLocalStorage } = require('async_hooks');
     const asyncLocalStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage();

     asyncLocalStorage.run(new Map(), () => {
       asyncLocalStorage.getStore().set('key', 'value');
     });
     ```

5. **Full ICU Support**
   - **Affected Feature**: Internationalization.
   - **What Changed**: Full ICU is now included by default, enhancing support for formatting dates, numbers, and strings.
   - **Migration**: No action required unless explicitly disabling ICU in previous versions.

6. **Deprecation of `process.binding()`**
   - **Affected Feature**: Internal bindings.
   - **What Changed**: Direct use of `process.binding()` is discouraged.
   - **Migration**: Replace with public APIs where possible.

7. **Changes in Streams**
   - **Affected Feature**: Node Streams.
   - **What Changed**: Updates to the stream API for better consistency and performance.
   - **Migration**: Review stream usage for compatibility with the updated API.

### 3. Migration Guide

#### **General Recommendations**
- **Test Thoroughly**: Run your test suite against Node.js 14 to identify potential issues.
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all third-party libraries are compatible with Node.js 14.
- **Use Linting Tools**: Tools like ESLint can help identify deprecated or incompatible code.

#### **Code Examples**

1. **Optional Chaining**
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const value = obj && obj.property && obj.property.subProperty;

   // After
   const value = obj?.property?.subProperty;
   ```

2. **Nullish Coalescing**
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const value = obj.property !== undefined && obj.property !== null ? obj.property : 'default';

   // After
   const value = obj.property ?? 'default';
   ```

3. **Diagnostic Reporting**
   ```javascript
   // Generate a diagnostic report
   process.report.writeReport('./report.json');
   ```

4. **AsyncLocalStorage**
   ```javascript
   const { AsyncLocalStorage } = require('async_hooks');
   const asyncLocalStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage();

   asyncLocalStorage.run(new Map(), () => {
     asyncLocalStorage.getStore().set('key', 'value');
   });
   ```

### 4. Additional Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: While Node.js 14 introduces several new features, most existing code should work without modification unless it relies on deprecated or removed features.
- **Performance Improvements**: The V8 engine upgrade and stream API changes may result in performance improvements for many applications.

By following this guide, developers can ensure a smooth transition from Node.js 13 to 14 while taking advantage of the new features and improvements.
