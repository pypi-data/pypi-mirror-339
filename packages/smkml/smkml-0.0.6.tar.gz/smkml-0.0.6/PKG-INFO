# SMKML - Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithm

SMKML is a Python library that merges Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Means clustering, allowing both supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Features
- **Automatic Mode Selection:** Handles both labeled and unlabeled data.
- **High Accuracy (>99.6%)** using optimized algorithms.
- **Simple API** for easy integration.

## Installation
```bash
pip install smkml
