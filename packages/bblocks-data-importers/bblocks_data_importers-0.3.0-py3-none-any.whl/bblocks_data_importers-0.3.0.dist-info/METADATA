# bblocks_data_importers

A package to import data from major humanitarian, development and financial institutions.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install bblocks_data_importers
```

## Example Usage

Import the package and use the various importer objects to access data from different sources.

```python
import bblocks_data_importers as bbdata
```

To access data from the IMF's World Economic Outlook use a WEO object:

weo = bbdata.WEO() # Create a WEO object
df = weo.get_data() # Get the data as a pandas DataFrame
```

Available importers include:

- `GHED` to access WHO's Global Health Expenditure Database
- `WFPFoodSecurity` and `WFPInflation` to access the World Food Programme's Food Security and Inflation data
- `WorldBank` to access the World Bank data
- `InternationalDebtStatistics` to access the World Bank's International Debt Statistics
