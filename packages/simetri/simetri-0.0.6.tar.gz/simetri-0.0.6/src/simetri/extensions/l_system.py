    """Generate a Lindenmayer system (L-system) using the given rules.

    An L-system is a parallel rewriting system that uses recursive rules to
    generate complex patterns. This function interprets the generated string
    as turtle graphics commands.

    Args:
        rules: A dictionary with characters as keys and strings as values.
               Each character in the axiom or resulting string will be replaced
               by its corresponding rule in each iteration.
        axiom: The initial string to start the L-system.
        angle: The angle (in degrees) for turtle rotation commands.
        dist: The distance for turtle forward/backward movement.
        n: The number of iterations to apply the rules.
        d_actions: Optional dictionary mapping characters to turtle methods.
                  This allows extending the default command set.

    Returns:
        Batch: A batch of shapes representing the L-system drawing.

    Example:
        >>> rules = {'F': 'F+F-F-F+F'}  # Koch curve
        >>> batch = l_system(rules, 'F', 60, 10, 3)
