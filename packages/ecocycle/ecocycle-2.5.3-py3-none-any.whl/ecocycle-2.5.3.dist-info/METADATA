# _EcoCycle_ - Cycle Into A Greener Tomorrow

Our program was originally developed for the Lenovo and Intel's EDUtech ASIA hackathon, under the sustainable campus theme.

Through deliberation, we decided to create a functional program for proof of concept. Thus, the _EcoCycle_ program was born.

# The _EcoCycle_ program: 
- Uses user profiles for personalized stats
- Has a password-protected admin page that displays a summary of total distance, total price, pedal point balance. 
- Has a user summary page. 
- Has a booking page allowing users to place orders for free rides. 
- Displays the Carbon Dioxide offset by _EcoCycle_ and by each individual user. 
- Displays the total calories burned for each journey. 
- Follows proper procedure for scalability by ensuring all def functions have their relevant #explanations and names# allowing for mass scalability if needed.
- Has the appropriate RESET protocols for use after debugging.

> [!NOTE]
> The following parts of the program were written collaboratively with the help of large language models:
- Full Google Sheets integration with a concise graph displaying the effect of the distance on the CO2 footprint.
- Weather forecast integration.
- Travel time estimator with real-time traffic and weather conditions.


# Pip Library Compatibility
We are thrilled to announce that with _EcoCycle_ _Version 2.0_ , not only is this program available on the releases to download and run locally - it has just been added to the PyPI package installation library!

**You can run it on your local machine with the following command: 
    `pip install ecocycle`**

This command will install all relevant dependencies that _EcoCycle_ needs to run optimally, saving clients valuable time when the program is first hosted.

> [!TIP]
> Should you want to uninstall the _ecocycle_ pip package at any time, run this command:
>     `pip uninstall ecocycle`

This command will uninstall **all** files that were installed by the installation command. 


We suggest installing the _ecocycle_ package from the command line to streamline your experience and to ensure that all packages run from the program are automatically updated.

We also strongly suggest all users use the latest version of _EcoCycle_ at all times as we update many file dependencies with each release for safety. 

# _EcoCycle_'s use of the Apache 2 License: 
At _EcoCycle_, we're not just building software; we're cultivating a regenerative ecosystem of technological solutions for a sustainable future. Our choice of the Apache 2.0 license wasn't a matter of convenience – it's core to our mission. We see the Apache 2.0 license not as a restriction, but as a powerful catalyst for collaborative growth.
