    """
    Event that indicates a frame has been navigated to a new URL.

    This is essential for tracking navigation within iframes, allowing for
    updates to the application state or user interface based on the content

    """

    JS_DIALOG_CLOSED = 'Page.javascriptDialogClosed'
    """
    Event fired when a JavaScript dialog (such as an alert or confirmation)
    is closed.

    actions to be taken after a dialog has been dismissed.
    """

    JS_DIALOG_OPENING = 'Page.javascriptDialogOpening'
    """
    Event triggered when a JavaScript dialog is about to open.

    This event can be used to intervene in the opening of the dialog, such as
    providing automated responses or logging dialog interactions.
    """

    LIFECYCLE_EVENT = 'Page.lifecycleEvent'
    """
    Event representing a generic lifecycle event for the page.

    This event is a catch-all for various lifecycle-related events and can be
    used for monitoring changes in the page state throughout its lifetime.
    """

    WINDOW_OPENED = 'Page.windowOpen'

    or new tabs.
    """

    DOCUMENT_OPENED = 'Page.documentOpened'
    """
    Event that signifies a new document has been opened in the page.

    This event is important for tracking changes in the document context,
    particularly in environments where documents can be dynamically created
    or loaded.
    """

    FRAME_STARTED_LOADING = 'Page.frameStartedLoading'
    """
    Event triggered when a frame starts loading content.

    This event is useful for tracking the loading state of frames,
    enabling developers to manage loading indicators or perform actions when
    frames begin loading resources.
    """

    FRAME_STOPPED_LOADING = 'Page.frameStoppedLoading'
    """
    Event that indicates a frame has stopped loading content.
