# openapi-client

API for application developers

This Python directory was automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. However it the generated code was altered to make compatible with the rest of the project.

- API version: 1.0.0

### Steps to update client directory

1. Fetch the api schema from the API endpoint \[https://codegen-sh--rest-api.modal.run/api/openapi.json\](schema file)
1. generate the client code with the following command:

```bash
openapi-generator generate -i openapi.yaml -g python -o ./client
```

3. This command will generate a lot of unused files we just need to include the files in the `openapi_client` directory to the project.

1. May need to fix the imports for `openapi_client` to be fully qualified import paths.

1. TODO: make updates more streamlined. Ideally setup this api client as it's own package so all it takes is to generate the new code, no addtional manual steps are needed.
