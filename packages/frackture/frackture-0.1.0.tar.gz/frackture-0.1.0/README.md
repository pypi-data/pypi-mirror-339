# Frackture

A universal symbolic compression system that uses recursive logic and entropy signatures to compress data while preserving identity and structure.

## Features

- Universal data preprocessing
- Symbolic fingerprinting
- Entropy channel encoding
- Self-optimization with decoder feedback
- Fixed-size compression output (~96 bytes)

## Requirements

- NumPy

## Usage

See the frackture.py file for detailed implementation and usage examples.
