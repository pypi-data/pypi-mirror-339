Feel free to contact me at [zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu](mailto:zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu). I'm more than happy to take any questions, discussion, feedback, or criticism. I also welcome any requests to share/explain code or help adapt it for your purposes â€” RedPlanet is the tool I wish I had when I started in this field a few years ago, and I'd love to play a part in lowering barriers to entry for anyone else who has passion/interest in this field :)
