## [1] Planned Features

- ^^Breaking changes^^
    - (None currently planned)
- ^^Major features^^
    - [x] Plotting (with hillshade background...?)
    - [ ] Heat flow & Curie depths
    - [ ] Add MAVEN magnetometer module
- ^^Known bugs^^
    - [ ] boug data has weird wraparound at lon 180 -- reproduce, run `import redplanet as rp; rp.Crust.boug.load('Genova2016'); d = 1.e-6; print(rp.Crust.boug.get(-180 + d, 0)); print(rp.Crust.boug.get( 180 - d, 0))`
        - although I'm pretty sure this is a bug in the data itself, not in the code...?
- ^^Minor functional changes/updates^^
    - [ ] Update crater database with new [IAU additions](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?Target=20_Mars&Feature%20Type=9_Crater,%20craters){target="_blank"}
        - Redplanet currently uses a database up to 2024-11-26 with 1218 craters -- as of 2025-02-27, there are 1231 craters (13 additions).
- ^^Software changes^^
    - [ ] Auto-generated changelogs from "conventional commits" standard
        - ["commitizen"](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commands/changelog/) seems promising
        - [thoughts of a robot](https://chatgpt.com/share/67e446be-c1bc-800e-958d-e7fac0f1672b)
    - [ ] Publish to conda forge ([tutorial](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/publish-conda-forge.html#how-to-publish-your-package-on-conda-forge))
        - I think it needs to be added/approved manually first, then I can automate it with a GH action
    - [x] Add GitHub actions for CI/CD
        - Specifically, GH actions for [running tests with uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/#syncing-and-running), and [publishing the site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-github-actions) (see justfile for more specific commands!)
    - [ ] Website: fix `mkdocstrings` config so it [selectively inspects objects](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/guide/users/how-to/selectively-inspect/) with the `@substitute_docstring` decorator, instead of [forcing dynamic analysis](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/guide/users/loading/?h=dynamic+analysis#forcing-dynamic-analysis) for everything
    - [ ] Website: find a way to do citations via bibtex in the website itself, preferrably with footnotes
        - maybe use [`shyamd-mkdocs-bibtex`](https://github.com/shyamd/mkdocs-bibtex)?
    - [ ] Switch from `pandas` to `polars` to save a lot of space and slight performance improvements (move pandas to optional dependecy group)
    - [ ] Change all `loader` modules so they have an additional semi-private method which returns the respective `GriddedData` object, which is then assigned to the global variable by the `load()`/`load(...)`/`_load()` method. This is more clean and extensible in edge cases, e.g. `Crust.moho` wants the pysh topo model to make a crthick model (kind of).
    - [ ] Move `DatasetManager` to `redplanet.helper_functions`?
    - [ ] Add `plotly` as an alternative engine for `redplanet.plot(...)`.

## [2] Changelog

RedPlanet follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/){target="_blank"} standard. In short, this means that version numbers follow the pattern `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where `MAJOR` is incremented for breaking changes (i.e. not backwards compatible), `MINOR` is incremented for new features, and `PATCH` is incremented for bug fixes.


??? info "Complete rewrite in 2024 September & deleting v1.0.0"

    I completely rewrote this project in 2024 September, erasing the entire git history and restarting from scratch. On PyPI, I deleted the only version which which was ever published (v1.0.0), so it's impossible to download now (as opposed to "yanking" which would allow for downloading if the exact version were accidentally requested). An archive of the old repo is available here: https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet_archive-240910

self note:

- Take inspiration from the following:
    - [mihon](https://mihon.app/changelogs/) (this is much more comprehensible)
    - [shtools](https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/release-notes-v4.html)
    - [uv (but this is only on github) â€” but tbh, i don't really love these...? it's always been a bit confusing to parse](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

&nbsp;

Bonus: These badges track PyPI downloads, but they're quite misleading since I'm pretty sure my automated tests with GitHub actions, my online Google Colab demo, and/or some other source are wildly inflating the download count. Still fun to see though :)
