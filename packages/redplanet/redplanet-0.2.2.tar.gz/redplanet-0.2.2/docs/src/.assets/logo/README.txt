logo creation process/info here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E3UaZYaRY04UZPuzRAF-wS9X6aT8n1B5wzZ9yiY2Z8o/edit?usp=sharing

NOTE: Currently, the logos are grainy PNGs since they were generated by AI. At some point I'll generate some good SVGs, but until then, I'm not including the image files in the git repo to save on size. Instead, they're downloaded whenever the site is built via the justfile (`just _download-logos`).
