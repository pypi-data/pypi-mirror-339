how can i convert this code into a package that cann be installed ?

GitHub Copilot: To convert your code into a package that can be installed, you need to create a setup.py file and organize your code into a package directory. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Organize your code into a directory structure. For example:

```
my_package/
    __init__.py
    amqp_consumer.py
setup.py
```

In the `__init__.py` file, you can import the `AMQPConsumer` class so it can be easily accessed:

```python
from .amqp_consumer import AMQPConsumer
```

2. Create a setup.py file in the same directory as your package directory. Here's a basic example:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='my_package',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'pika',
        'jsonschema'
    ],
)
```

Replace `'my_package'` and `'0.1'` with your package name and version. In `install_requires`, list any packages that your code depends on.

3. Now you can install your package using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

Run this command in the same directory as your setup.py file. This will install your package in your current Python environment.

4. After installing, you can import and use your package in Python code like this:

```python
from my_package import AMQPConsumer

# Use AMQPConsumer...
```

Replace `'my_package'` with the name of your package.

is it possible to specify the versions of pika and jsonschema that is required ?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, it's possible to specify the versions of `pika` and `jsonschema` that are required in the `setup.py` file. You can specify the version number directly after the package name, separated by `==`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='my_package',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'pika==1.1.0',
        'jsonschema==3.2.0'
    ],
)
```

In this example, `pika` version 1.1.0 and `jsonschema` version 3.2.0 are required. Replace these with the actual versions you want to require.

When someone installs your package, pip will install these specific versions of `pika` and `jsonschema` if they are not already installed. If a different version is already installed, pip will attempt to change it to the required version.

How can I distribute my Python package to the Python Package Index (PyPI)?

GitHub Copilot: To distribute your Python package to the Python Package Index (PyPI), you need to follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the necessary tools installed. You can install them with pip:

```bash
pip install setuptools twine
```

2. Create a `setup.py` file in your project directory if you haven't already. This file should contain metadata about your package like the name, version, description, and dependencies.

3. Create a source distribution of your package:

```bash
python setup.py sdist
```

This will create a `.tar.gz` file in a newly created `dist/` directory.

4. Now you can upload this distribution to PyPI using `twine`:

Generate token and save it in a file called `.pypirc` in your home directory. The file should look like this: $HOME/.pypirc
example:
```conf
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = <password>
```

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

This command will prompt you for your PyPI username and password. If you don't have a PyPI account, you can create one on the [PyPI website](https://pypi.org/).

### Push a specific version
```bash
twine upload dist/my_package-0.1.tar.gz
```
Example
```bash
twine upload dist/ezyli_utils-2.0.7.tar.gz
```

5. After uploading, your package should be available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install your-package-name
```

Replace `your-package-name` with the name of your package.

Note: Before uploading to PyPI, you might want to test your package upload on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/), which is a separate instance of the Python Package Index that allows you to try distribution tools and processes without affecting the real index. You can upload to TestPyPI with `twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*`.


#RABBITMQ PRODUCER
Using the RabbitMQProducer class in this way should generally work well, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

Thread Safety: The pika library is not thread-safe. If you're planning to use this producer in a multi-threaded environment (like in a Django view), you might run into issues. Each thread should have its own connection and channel.

Error Handling: The sample code provided tries to reconnect when a connection error occurs, but it doesn't handle all possible exceptions. Depending on your application's needs, you might want to add more robust error handling.

Connection Management: Connections to RabbitMQ are relatively expensive to create. It's a good practice to reuse connections and channels where possible. However, you should also ensure connections are closed properly when they're no longer needed to avoid resource leaks.
