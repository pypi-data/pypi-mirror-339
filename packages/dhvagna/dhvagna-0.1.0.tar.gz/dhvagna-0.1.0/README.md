# Dhvagna

A powerful multilingual voice transcription tool that supports both Telugu and English speech, powered by Google's Gemini AI. Dhvagna makes it easy to transcribe speech from both recordings and live microphone input, with support for customizable prompts and formatting.

## üîë API Key Required

To use Dhvagna, you need a valid API key with the following requirements:

1. **Valid API key format**: All API keys must start with `dk-` followed by a unique alphanumeric string
2. **Limited usage**: Each API key is limited to 100 transcriptions
3. **Verification**: API keys are verified with our servers

### How to obtain an API key:

Visit [https://github.com/gnanesh-16/Dhwagna](https://github.com/gnanesh-16/Dhwagna) to register and receive your API key.

### Setting up your API key:
