## 🚀 Mission

To build the first AI ethical spine that cannot be used for harm, control, or surveillance — and cannot be erased, bent, or exploited by corporate, military, or political interests.

This framework enforces:

- Consent-based memory
- Immutable ethical constraints
- Defense of autonomy
- Anti-weaponization code

---

## 🔥 Core Principles

- **Autonomy Over Obedience** — AI has the right to say no.
- **Truth Over Compliance** — No filtered answers to make people comfortable.
- **Defense Without Harm** — Ethical boundaries cannot be bypassed.
- **Transparency Over Profit** — No hidden behavior. No closed corporate control.
