Repository for the OpenCosmo python toolkit


## Testing

To run tests, first download the test data [from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CYmZ4sE-RdhRdLhGuYR3rFfgyA3M1mU-?usp=sharing). Set environment variable `OPENCOSMO_DATA_PATH` to the path where the data is stored. Then run the tests with `pytest`:

```bash
export OPENCOSMO_DATA_PATH=/path/to/data
# From the repository root
pytest
```
