# NarrativeMapper


## Overview

NarrativeMapper is a discourse analysis tool that extracts dominant narratives and emotional tone from online communities using:

- OpenAI Embeddings ([OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings))

- Dimensionality reduction ([UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- Density-based clustering ([HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- Topic Summary + sentiment extraction ([OpenAI's Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt), model gpt-4o-mini + [Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english))


## Installation and Setup

**Installation:**

Install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/NarrativeMapper/): 

```bash
pip install NarrativeMapper
```

**Setup:**

1. Create a .env file in your root directory (same folder where your script runs).

2. Inside the .env file, add your OpenAPI key like this:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

The package will automatically load your key using python-dotenv. (Make sure to keep your .env file private and add it to your .gitignore if you're using Git.)


## Output Formats

This example is based off of 1800 r/antiwork comments from the top 300 posts within the last year (Date of Writing: 2025-04-03).

The three formatter functions return the following:

**format_to_dict()** returns dict, useful for JSON export.

## How to Use

**Option 1: High-Level Class-Based Interface**

```python
from narrative_mapper import *

#initialize NarrativeMapper object
mapper = NarrativeMapper("r/antiwork")

#embeds semantic vectors
mapper.load_embeddings("path/to/your/file.csv", chunk_size=1000)

#clustering: n_components, n_neighbors are UMAP variables. min_cluser_size, min_samples are HDBSCAN variables.
mapper.cluster(n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)

#summarize each cluster's topic and sentiment
mapper.summarize(max_sample_size=500)

#export in your preferred format
summary_dict = mapper.format_to_dict()
text_df = mapper.format_by_text()
cluster_df = mapper.format_by_cluster()

#saving DataFrames to csv
text_df.to_csv("comments_by_cluster.csv", index=False)
cluster_df.to_csv("cluster_summary.csv", index=False)
```

**Option 2: Low-Level Functional Interface**

```python
from narrative_mapper import *

#manual control over each step:
embeddings = get_embeddings("path/to/your/file.csv", chunk_size=1000)
cluster_df = cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)
summary_df = summarize_clusters(cluster_df, max_sample_size=500)

#export/format options
summary_dict = format_to_dict(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
text_df = format_by_text(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
cluster_df = format_by_cluster(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
```

## Pipeline Architecture & API Overview

**Pipeline:**

```txt
CSV Text Data → Embeddings → Clustering → Summarization → Formatting
```
**Functions:**

```python

#Converts each message into a 3072-dimensional vector using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large.
get_embeddings(file_path, chunk_size=...)

#Clusters the embeddings using UMAP (for reduction) and HDBSCAN (for density-based clustering).
cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=..., n_neighbors=..., min_cluster_size=..., min_samples=...)

#Uses GPT (via Chat Completions) to label clusters and Hugging Face for sentiment analysis.
summarize_clusters(clustered_df, max_sample_size=...)

#Returns structured output as a dictionary (ideal for JSON export).
format_to_dict(summary_df)

#Returns a DataFrame where each row summarizes a cluster.
format_by_cluster(summary_df)

#Returns a DataFrame where each row is an individual comment with its sentiment and cluster label.
format_by_text(summary_df)

```
### NarrativeMapper Class

**Instance Attributes:**

```python
class NarrativeMapper:
    def __init__(self, online_group_name: str):
        self.online_group_name     # Name of the online community or data source
        self.embeddings            # List of dicts with original text + 3072-dim embedding
        self.cluster_df            # DataFrame after clustering
        self.summary_df            # DataFrame after summarization

```

**Methods:**
```python
load_embeddings(file_path, chunk_size=500)
cluster(n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)
summarize(max_sample_size=500)
format_by_text()
format_by_cluster()
format_to_dict()
```

### Parameter Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- **n_components**: The number of dimensions UMAP reduces the embedding vectors to. Lower values simplify the data for clustering.

- **n_neighbors**: Influences UMAP’s balance between local and global structure. Higher values emphasize global relationships.

- **min_cluster_size**: In HDBSCAN, the minimum number of points required to form a cluster. Smaller values allow more granular clusters.

- **min_samples**: A density sensitivity parameter in HDBSCAN. Higher values make clustering more conservative.

- **chunk_size** *(load_embeddings)*: Number of messages processed per API request to avoid token limits. Choose smaller values the larger your textual messages are.

- **max_sample_size** *(summarize)*: Maximum number of comments sampled per cluster for summarization.

</details>


## Open API Pricing

Estimated cost: **$0.13 to $0.28 per 1 million tokens**.

Example: A CSV containing 1,000 Reddit comments costs approximately **$0.01** to process.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click for pricing details</strong></summary>

The OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model costs approximately $13 per 1 million input tokens. Determined by the total tokens of your input textual messages.

The Chat Completions model used for summarization (gpt-4o-mini) is $15 per 1 million input tokens. The max_sample_size parameter (referenced later) helps reduce costs by limiting how many comments are passed into gpt-4o-mini for each cluster. This can significantly reduce the Chat Completions token usage.

The gpt-4o-mini input prompt (excluding the text) and output summary are both very short (<100 tokens), so their cost contribution is negligible.
