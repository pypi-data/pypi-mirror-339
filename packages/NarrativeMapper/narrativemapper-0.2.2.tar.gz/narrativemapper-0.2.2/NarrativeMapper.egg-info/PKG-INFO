# NarrativeMapper


## Overview

Whether you're coding in Python or simply running a single command in your terminal, NarrativeMapper gives you instant insight into the dominant stories behind the noise.

Ever wonder what stories are dominating Reddit, Twitter, or any corner of the internet? NarrativeMapper clusters similar online discussions and uses OpenAI’s GPT to summarize the dominant narratives, tone, and sentiment. Built for researchers, journalists, analysts, and anyone trying to make sense of the chaos.

- Extracts dominant narratives from messy text data

- Clusters similar posts using embeddings + UMAP + HDBSCAN

- Summarizes each cluster with GPT

- Analyzes sentiment per narrative

- Plug-and-play pipeline: **CLI**, class-based, or functional

- Uses OpenAI Embeddings ([OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings))

- Dimensionality reduction ([UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- Density-based clustering ([HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- Topic summary + sentiment extraction ([OpenAI's Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt), model gpt-4o-mini + [Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english))

**Setup:**

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to view setup process</strong></summary>

1. Create a .env file in your root directory (same folder where your script runs).

2. Inside the .env file, add your OpenAI API key like this:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

3. Before importing narrative_mapper, make sure to load your .env like this:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from narrative_mapper import *
```

(Make sure to keep your .env file private and add it to your .gitignore if you're using Git.)

## How to Use

### Option 1: CLI (zero code)

Run NarrativeMapper directly from the terminal:

```bash
narrativemapper path/to/your.csv online_group_name
```
This will:

- Load the CSV

- Automatically embed, cluster, and summarize the comments

- Output a formatted results file in the current directory (output_summary.txt)

- Print the summarized narratives and sentiment to the terminal

**Note:** Make sure you're running the CLI from the same directory where your .env file is located (Unless you have set OPENAI_API_KEY globally in your environment).

### Option 2: Class-Based Interface

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from narrative_mapper import *
import pandas as pd

file_df = pd.read_csv("file-path")

#initialize NarrativeMapper object
mapper = NarrativeMapper(file_df, "r/antiwork")

#embeds semantic vectors
mapper.load_embeddings(batch_size=100)

#clustering: main UMAP and HDBSCAN variables along with kwargs for more customizability.
umap_kwargs =  {'min_dist': 0.0}
mapper.cluster(n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15, umap_kwargs=umap_kwargs)

#summarize each cluster's topic and sentiment
mapper.summarize(max_sample_size=500)

#export in your preferred format
summary_dict = mapper.format_to_dict()
text_df = mapper.format_by_text()
cluster_df = mapper.format_by_cluster()

#saving DataFrames to csv
text_df.to_csv("comments_by_cluster.csv", index=False)
cluster_df.to_csv("cluster_summary.csv", index=False)
```

### Option 3: Functional Interface

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from narrative_mapper import *
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("file-path")

#manual control over each step:
embeddings = get_embeddings(file_df, batch_size=100)
cluster_df = cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)
summary_df = summarize_clusters(cluster_df, max_sample_size=500)

#export/format options
summary_dict = format_to_dict(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
text_df = format_by_text(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
cluster_df = format_by_cluster(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
```

## Output Formats

This example is based off of 1800 r/antiwork comments from the top 300 posts within the last year (Date of Writing: 2025-04-03).

The three formatter functions return the following:

**format_to_dict()** returns dict with following format:

### Parameter Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- **n_components:** The number of dimensions UMAP reduces the embedding vectors to. Lower values simplify the data for clustering.

- **n_neighbors:** Influences UMAP’s balance between local and global structure. Higher values emphasize global relationships.

- **min_cluster_size:** In HDBSCAN, the minimum number of points required to form a cluster. Smaller values allow more granular clusters.

- **min_samples:** A density sensitivity parameter in HDBSCAN. Higher values make clustering more conservative.

- **umap_kwargs:** Allows for input of other UMAP parameters.

- **hdbscan_kwags:** Allows for input of other HDBSCAN parameters.

- **batch_size:** Number of messages processed per API request to avoid token limits. Choose smaller values the larger your textual messages are.

- **max_sample_size:** Maximum number of comments sampled per cluster for summarization.

</details>


## Estimated Cost (OpenAI Pricing)

Estimated cost: **$0.13 to $0.28 per 1 million tokens**.

Example: A CSV containing 1,000 Reddit comments costs approximately **$0.01** to process.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click for pricing details</strong></summary>

The OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model costs approximately $0.13 per 1 million input tokens. Determined by the total tokens of your input textual messages.

The Chat Completions model used for summarization (gpt-4o-mini) is $0.15 per 1 million input tokens. The max_sample_size parameter (referenced later) helps reduce costs by limiting how many comments are passed into gpt-4o-mini for each cluster. This can significantly reduce the Chat Completions token usage.

The gpt-4o-mini input prompt (excluding the text) and output summary are both very short (<100 tokens), so their cost contribution is negligible.
