# djfapi

A utility library to integrate and use fastapi with the django orm.

## üöß This project is WIP and is subject to change at any time

This project is currently in the alpha state, even though it can be used in production with some caution. Make sure to fix the version in your requirements.txt and review changes frequently.

## Installation

`pip install djfapi`

## Features

### Sentry

Provides optional sentry integration.

### djdantic usage

See [djdantic](https://github.com/Voltane-EU/djdantic) for schema usage.

### Automatic Route Generation

Declare routes without having to write routes using the `djfapi.routing.django.DjangoRouterSchema`.

The `DjangoRouterSchema` will supply a router, which just has to be included in the FastAPI app.

#### Example for Routes

```python
from djfapi.routing.django import DjangoRouterSchema, SecurityScopes


transaction_token = JWTToken(scheme_name="Transaction Token")


def company_objects_filter(access: Access) -> Q:
    q = Q(tenant_id=access.tenant_id)
    if access.scope.selector != 'any':
        q &= Q(employees__user_id=access.user_id, employees__type__in=[models.Employee.EmployeeType.OWNER, models.Employee.EmployeeType.ADMIN])

    return q


router = DjangoRouterSchema(
    name='companies',
    model=models.Company,
    get=schemas.response.Company,
    create=schemas.request.CompanyCreate,
    update=schemas.request.CompanyUpdate,
    security=transaction_token,
    security_scopes=SecurityScopes(
        get=['business.companies.read.any', 'business.companies.read.own',],
        post=['business.companies.create',],
        patch=['business.companies.update.any', 'business.companies.update.own',],
        put=['business.companies.update.any', 'business.companies.update.own',],
        delete=['business.companies.delete.any', 'business.companies.delete.own',],
    ),
    objects_filter=company_objects_filter,
    children=[
        DjangoRouterSchema(
            name='departments',
            model=models.CompanyDepartment,
            get=schemas.response.CompanyDepartment,
            create=schemas.request.CompanyDepartmentCreate,
            update=schemas.request.CompanyDepartmentUpdate,
            children=[
                DjangoRouterSchema(
                    name='teams',
                    model=models.CompanyDepartmentTeam,
                    get=schemas.response.CompanyDepartmentTeam,
                    create=schemas.request.CompanyDepartmentTeamCreate,
                    update=schemas.request.CompanyDepartmentTeamUpdate,
                ),
            ]
        ),
        DjangoRouterSchema(
            name='costcenters',
            model=models.CompanyCostcenter,
            get=schemas.response.CompanyCostcenter,
            create=schemas.request.CompanyCostcenterCreate,
            update=schemas.request.CompanyCostcenterUpdate,
        ),
    ]
)
```

## Info for using FastAPI and Django

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Connection Leaks

When using FastAPI with Django and performing django db operations from within a FastAPI Endpoint, required signals regarding request handling from django are not called.
The Django signals `django.core.signals.request_started` and `django.core.signals.request_finished` need to be called prior and after every request (which uses the django orm in it's endpoint), otherwise database connections are leaked undefinedly. Those signals must be called from the **same** thread, in which the orm is used.

There is a method decorator provided by djfapi in `djfapi.utils.fastapi_django.request_signalling`, which can be applied to any (sync) endpoints. For autogenerated endpoints or manual endpoints decorated with a `DjangoRouterSchema.endpoint`, this is already done.
