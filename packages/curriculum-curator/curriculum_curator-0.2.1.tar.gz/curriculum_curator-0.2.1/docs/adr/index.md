# Architecture Decision Records

This section contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting the significant architectural decisions made during the development of Curriculum Curator.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes a choice the team made and why that choice was made.

## Why do we use ADRs?

ADRs help us:

- Document important decisions for future reference
- Communicate the reasoning behind choices to new team members
- Track the evolution of the system architecture over time
- Provide context for current design decisions

## Available ADRs

Here are the current ADRs for the Curriculum Curator project:

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [ADR-0001](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) | Record Architecture Decisions | Accepted |
| [ADR-0002](0002-validation-remediation-design.md) | Validation and Remediation Design | Accepted |
| [ADR-0003](0003-workflow-configuration-format.md) | Workflow Configuration Format | Accepted |
| [ADR-0004](0004-interactive-workflow-builder.md) | Interactive Workflow Builder | Accepted |
| [ADR-0005](0005-interactive-interfaces.md) | Interactive Interfaces | Accepted |

## ADR Process

1. **Proposal**: When a significant architectural decision needs to be made, an ADR is drafted
2. **Discussion**: The team discusses the proposed ADR
3. **Acceptance**: Once consensus is reached, the ADR is accepted
4. **Implementation**: The decision is implemented in the codebase
5. **Review**: ADRs can be reviewed and updated as the system evolves

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use the [template](template.md) as a starting point.
