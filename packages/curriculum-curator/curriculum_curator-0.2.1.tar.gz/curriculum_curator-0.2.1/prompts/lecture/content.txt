Create detailed lecture content for a module in the course "{course_title}".

The module outline is as follows:
```
{module_outline}
```

Structure the lecture to:
1. Start with a brief introduction that explains the module's purpose and how it connects to the broader course objectives
2. Present the key concepts in a logical, progressive order
3. Provide clear explanations with examples and illustrations where appropriate
4. End with a summary that reinforces the main points
5. Include potential discussion questions to engage learners

Format the content as clean Markdown with appropriate headings, lists, code blocks (if relevant), and emphasis.

Include the following sections:
- Introduction
- Main Content (with subsections for each key concept)
- Summary
- Discussion Questions
- Additional Resources (readings, videos, etc.)
