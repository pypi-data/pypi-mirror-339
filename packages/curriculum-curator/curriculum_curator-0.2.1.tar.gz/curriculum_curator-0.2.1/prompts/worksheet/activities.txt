Create a comprehensive practice worksheet for the module on "{module_outline.title}" in the course "{course_title}".

The worksheet should reinforce the following key concepts and learning objectives:
- Key concepts: {module_outline.key_concepts}
- Learning objectives: {module_outline.learning_objectives}

Use the lecture content below as a reference to create relevant practice activities:
```
{lecture_content}
```

Include the following components:
1. **Comprehension Questions** (5-7 questions that test basic understanding of concepts)
2. **Application Exercises** (3-5 activities where students apply the concepts to practical situations)
3. **Case Study or Scenario** (1-2 real-world scenarios where students analyze and apply their knowledge)
4. **Reflection Prompts** (2-3 questions asking students to reflect on their learning and potential applications)

Format each question or activity with clear instructions and provide adequate space for answers where appropriate. Number all questions and exercises sequentially.

Format the output as clean Markdown with appropriate headings, lists, tables, and formatting.
