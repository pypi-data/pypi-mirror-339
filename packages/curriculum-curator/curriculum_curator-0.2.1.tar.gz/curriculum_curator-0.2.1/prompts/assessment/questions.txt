Create a comprehensive assessment for the module on "{module_outline.title}" in the course "{course_title}".

The assessment should evaluate student understanding of the following key concepts and learning objectives:
- Key concepts: {module_outline.key_concepts}
- Learning objectives: {module_outline.learning_objectives}

Use the lecture content below as a reference to create relevant assessment questions:
```
{lecture_content}
```

Include a balanced mix of question types:
1. **Multiple Choice Questions** (5-7 questions, with 4 options each, only one correct answer)
2. **Short Answer Questions** (3-5 questions requiring brief explanations, 2-3 sentences)
3. **Long Answer Questions** (1-2 questions requiring detailed explanations, connecting multiple concepts)
4. **Application Question** (1 scenario-based question where students apply their learning to solve a problem)

For multiple-choice questions, clearly indicate the correct answer.

Format the assessment with clear sections, numbering, and instructions for each question type. Include a header with the course title, module title, and total points.

Format the output as clean Markdown with appropriate headings, lists, and formatting.
